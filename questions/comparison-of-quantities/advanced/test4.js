    question:
      "A product is sold for $120 after a 20% discount. What was the original price?",
    options: ["$140", "$150", "$160", "$180"],
    correctAnswer: "$150",
    explanation:
      "Let the original price be x. After discount, Selling Price = x - 0.20x = 0.80x. Thus, 120 = 0.80x, so x = 120 / 0.80 = $150.",

    question:
      "A bag contains 3 red, 5 blue, and 2 green marbles. If a marble is drawn at random, what is the probability that it is either red or blue?",
    options: ["1/2", "5/10", "8/10", "3/10"],
    correctAnswer: "8/10",
    explanation:
      "Total marbles = 3 + 5 + 2 = 10. Probability of red or blue = (3 + 5) / 10 = 8/10.",

      "If the ratio of two numbers is 4:5 and their sum is 90, what are the two numbers?",
    options: ["40 and 50", "36 and 54", "32 and 58", "20 and 70"],
    correctAnswer: "36 and 54",
    explanation:
      "Let the numbers be 4x and 5x. Then 4x + 5x = 90, 9x = 90, x = 10. Therefore, the numbers are 4*10 = 40 and 5*10 = 50.",

    question:
      "A person buys 4 shirts at $25 each and sells them at $30 each. What is the percentage profit?",
    options: ["10%", "20%", "25%", "30%"],
    correctAnswer: "20%",
    explanation:
      "Cost Price = 4 * 25 = 100; Selling Price = 4 * 30 = 120. Profit = 120 - 100 = 20. Profit Percentage = (20/100) * 100 = 20%.",

    options: ["$25", "$30", "$35", "$40"],
    correctAnswer: "$36",
    explanation:
      "Cost per pen = $15 / 5 = $3. Therefore, cost of 12 pens = 12 * $3 = $36.",

      "A store owner sells a laptop for $1,200, making a profit of 20%. What was the cost price?",
    options: ["$900", "$950", "$1,000", "$1,050"],
    correctAnswer: "$1,000",
    explanation:
      "Let the cost price be x. Selling Price = x + 0.20x = 1.20x. Thus, 1200 = 1.20x, so x = 1200 / 1.20 = $1,000.",

    question:
      "If a person can complete a task in 10 hours, how long will it take for 5 people to complete the same task working together?",
    options: ["2 hours", "4 hours", "5 hours", "8 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "2 hours",
    explanation:
      "Work rate of 1 person = 1/10 tasks/hour. 5 people together = 5/10 = 1/2 tasks/hour. Time taken = 1 / (1/2) = 2 hours.",

    question:
      "A house is sold for $300,000 at a loss of 15%. What was the original price of the house?",

    correctAnswer: "$352,941.18",
    explanation:
      "Let the original price be x. Selling Price = x - 0.15x = 0.85x. Thus, 300,000 = 0.85x, so x = 300,000 / 0.85 = $352,941.18.",

    question:
      "A train leaves a station at 3 PM traveling at 60 km/h. Another train leaves the same station at 4 PM traveling at 90 km/h. At what time will the second train catch up to the first?",
    options: ["5 PM", "6 PM", "7 PM", "8 PM"],
    correctAnswer: "6 PM",
    explanation:
      "First train head start = 1 hour * 60 km/h = 60 km. Relative speed = 90 km/h - 60 km/h = 30 km/h. Time to catch up = 60 km / 30 km/h = 2 hours. Catch-up time = 4 PM + 2 hours = 6 PM.",

      "A machine can produce 500 units in 4 hours. How many units can it produce in 10 hours?",
    options: ["800", "1000", "1200", "1500"],
    correctAnswer: "1250",
    explanation:
      "Rate of production = 500 units / 4 hours = 125 units/hour. In 10 hours, it can produce 125 * 10 = 1250 units.",
