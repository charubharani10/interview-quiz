    options: ["1800 grams", "1500 grams", "1200 grams", "1000 grams"],
    correctAnswer: "1200 grams",

    options: ["161 cm", "162 cm", "163 cm", "164 cm"],
    correctAnswer: "161 cm",
    explanation:
      "Total height = 160 * 20 = 3200 cm. New total height = 3200 + 170 + 180 = 3550 cm. New average = 3550 / 22 = 161 cm.",

    correctAnswer: "29.5 years",
    explanation:
      "Assuming there were originally 5 friends, total age = 30 * 5 = 150 years. New total age = 150 - 40 + 25 = 135 years. New average = 135 / 5 = 27.",

    explanation:
      "Total of 12 numbers = 25 * 12 = 300. New total after removing one number = 20 * 11 = 220. Number removed = 300 - 220 = 80.",
