      "In a factory, the average production of 5 machines is 200 units per day. If one machine produces 300 units and the other four produce 180 units each, what is the average production of all machines?",
    options: ["198", "200", "202", "205"],
    correctAnswer: "198",
    explanation:
      "Total production = 300 + (4 * 180) = 300 + 720 = 1020 units. Average = 1020 / 5 = 204.",

      "A group of friends spent $500 in total for a dinner. If their average spending per person was $50 and one person spent $80, what was the average spending of the other people?",
    options: ["$45", "$48", "$50", "$52"],
    correctAnswer: "$48",
    explanation:
      "Total number of people = 500 / 50 = 10. Amount spent by others = 500 - 80 = 420. Average spending of others = 420 / 9 = 46.67.",

    question:
      "A student scored 70, 75, and 80 in three subjects. If the student's goal is to have an average score of 85 after taking one more subject, what is the minimum score required in the fourth subject?",
    options: ["95", "90", "85", "100"],
    correctAnswer: "100",
    explanation:
      "Total score needed for average of 85 = 4 * 85 = 340. Current total = 70 + 75 + 80 = 225. Required score in fourth subject = 340 - 225 = 115.",

    question:
      "A research study found that the average age of 50 participants is 40 years. If 10 new participants with an average age of 50 years are added, what is the new average age of all participants?",
    options: ["42", "44", "46", "48"],
    correctAnswer: "42",
    explanation:
      "Total age of 50 participants = 50 * 40 = 2000. Total age of new participants = 10 * 50 = 500. New total age = 2000 + 500 = 2500. New average = 2500 / 60 = 41.67.",

    options: ["168", "170", "172", "174"],
    correctAnswer: "172",
    explanation:
      "Total height of 5 people = 5 * 170 = 850 cm. New total height after replacing the tallest = 850 - tallest + 180. Since we don't know the tallest, assume an average height of 173 = 850 - 173 + 180 = 857. New average = 857 / 5 = 171.4.",

    correctAnswer: "75 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Total distance = 100 + 150 = 250 km. Total time = (100/60) + (150/90) = 1.67 + 1.67 = 3.34 hours. Average speed = 250 / 3.34 = 75 km/h.",

    options: ["90", "92", "95", "100"],
    correctAnswer: "100",
    explanation:
      "Total required for average of 90 = 5 * 90 = 450. Current total = 80 + 85 + 90 + 95 = 350. Score needed = 450 - 350 = 100.",
