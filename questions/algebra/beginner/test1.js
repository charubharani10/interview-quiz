    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 3 = 11?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "To solve for x, subtract 3 from both sides to get 2x = 8. Then, divide by 2 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution to the equation x - 5 = 10?",
    options: ["5", "10", "15", "20"],
    correctAnswer: "15",
    explanation:
      "Add 5 to both sides of the equation: x = 10 + 5, which simplifies to x = 15.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 3x = 12?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation: "To solve for x, divide both sides by 3: x = 12 / 3 = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 4x = 20, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation: "Divide both sides by 4 to find x: x = 20 / 4 = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 2y + 6 = 18?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 6 from both sides to get 2y = 12. Then, divide by 2 to find y = 6.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 5x - 2 = 3?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "1",
    explanation:
      "Add 2 to both sides to get 5x = 5, then divide by 5 to find x = 1.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 7x + 3 = 24?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 3 from both sides to get 7x = 21. Then, divide by 7 to find x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x: 10 - 3x = 7.",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "1",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 10 from both sides to get -3x = -3. Divide by -3 to find x = 1.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 2x + 4 = 12, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
