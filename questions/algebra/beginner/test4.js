    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 2(x + 3) = 14?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 2: x + 3 = 7. Then subtract 3 from both sides to get x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 4x = 28, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["6", "7", "8", "9"],
    correctAnswer: "7",
    explanation: "Divide both sides by 4 to find x: x = 28 / 4 = 7.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for y in the equation 9y + 18 = 0?",
    options: ["-2", "-1", "0", "1"],
    correctAnswer: "-2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 18 from both sides to get 9y = -18, then divide by 9 to find y = -2.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x in the equation 3x + 2 = 11.",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 2 from both sides to get 3x = 9, then divide by 3 to find x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation x/4 - 2 = 1?",
    options: ["8", "10", "12", "14"],
    correctAnswer: "12",
    explanation:
      "Add 2 to both sides to get x/4 = 3, then multiply by 4 to find x = 12.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 5y + 10 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["-1", "-2", "-3", "-4"],
    correctAnswer: "-2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 10 from both sides to get 5y = -10, then divide by 5 to find y = -2.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 15 = 3x + 6?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 6 from both sides to get 9 = 3x, then divide by 3 to find x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 6y - 18 = 0.",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 18 to both sides to get 6y = 18, then divide by 6 to find y = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 3 = 7?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 3 from both sides to get 2x = 4, then divide by 2 to find x = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 8y = 64, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["6", "7", "8", "9"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation: "Divide both sides by 8 to find y: y = 64 / 8 = 8.",
  },
