    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 3(x + 4) = 21?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "First, divide both sides by 3: x + 4 = 7. Then subtract 4 from both sides to get x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 2x - 5 = 9, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "7",
    explanation:
      "Add 5 to both sides to get 2x = 14, then divide by 2 to find x = 7.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 5y + 15 = 30?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 15 from both sides to get 5y = 15, then divide by 5 to find y = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x in the equation 4x + 1 = 13.",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 1 from both sides to get 4x = 12, then divide by 4 to find x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation x/2 + 6 = 12?",
    options: ["6", "10", "12", "16"],
    correctAnswer: "12",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 6 from both sides to get x/2 = 6, then multiply both sides by 2 to find x = 12.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 3x + 4 = 19, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then divide by 3 to find x = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for y in the equation 8y - 32 = 0?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Add 32 to both sides to get 8y = 32, then divide by 8 to find y = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x in the equation 10 = 2x + 4.",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4 from both sides to get 6 = 2x, then divide by 2 to find x = 3.",

  {
    question: "If 5y + 5 = 30, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["5", "10", "15", "20"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 5 from both sides to get 5y = 25, then divide by 5 to find y = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 7x - 14 = 0?",
    options: ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 14 to both sides to get 7x = 14, then divide by 7 to find x = 2.",
