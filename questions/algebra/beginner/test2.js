    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 5x + 15 = 30?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 15 from both sides to get 5x = 15. Then, divide by 5 to find x = 3.",
  },

    question: "If 6y = 54, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["8", "9", "10", "11"],
    correctAnswer: "9",
    explanation: "Divide both sides by 6 to find y: y = 54 / 6 = 9.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x: 4x - 8 = 0.",
    options: ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 8 to both sides to get 4x = 8, then divide by 4 to find x = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of y in the equation y/3 + 5 = 10?",
    options: ["10", "12", "15", "18"],
    correctAnswer: "15",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 5 from both sides to get y/3 = 5, then multiply by 3 to find y = 15.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 8 - 2x = 4?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 8 from both sides to get -2x = -4, then divide by -2 to find x = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 9x = 81, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["7", "8", "9", "10"],
    correctAnswer: "9",
    explanation: "Divide both sides by 9 to find x: x = 81 / 9 = 9.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 3x + 7 = 22?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then divide by 3 to find x = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 2y + 10 = 18.",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 10 from both sides to get 2y = 8, then divide by 2 to find y = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 12 - 4x = 0?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 4x to both sides to get 12 = 4x, then divide by 4 to find x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 7y - 21 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 21 to both sides to get 7y = 21, then divide by 7 to find y = 3.",
