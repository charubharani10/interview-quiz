    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 9x = 81?",
    options: ["7", "8", "9", "10"],
    correctAnswer: "9",
    explanation: "Divide both sides by 9 to find x = 81 / 9 = 9.",

    question: "If 4x + 4 = 20, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4 from both sides to get 4x = 16, then divide by 4 to find x = 4.",

    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 5y - 5 = 10?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 5 to both sides to get 5y = 15, then divide by 5 to find y = 3.",

    question: "Solve for x: 2x + 2 = 10.",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 2 from both sides to get 2x = 8, then divide by 2 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 7y = 28, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation: "Divide both sides by 7 to find y = 28 / 7 = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 5(x - 2) = 15?",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 5: x - 2 = 3. Then add 2 to both sides to get x = 5.",
  },

    question: "If 3y + 6 = 15, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 6 from both sides to get 3y = 9, then divide by 3 to find y = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 2(x + 3) = 14?",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 2: x + 3 = 7. Then subtract 3 from both sides to get x = 4.",
  },

    question: "If 6x + 12 = 30, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 12 from both sides to get 6x = 18, then divide by 6 to find x = 3.",
