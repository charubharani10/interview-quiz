    question: "If 5x - 10 = 0, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 10 to both sides to get 5x = 10, then divide by 5 to find x = 2.",
  },

    question: "Solve for y in the equation 12y + 24 = 60.",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 24 from both sides to get 12y = 36, then divide by 12 to find y = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 4(x - 2) = 12?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 4 to get x - 2 = 3, then add 2 to both sides to find x = 5.",
  },

    question: "If 3y - 9 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 9 to both sides to get 3y = 9, then divide by 3 to find y = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x in the equation 2x + 6 = 18.",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 6 from both sides to get 2x = 12, then divide by 2 to find x = 6.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 15 - 3y = 6?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 15 from both sides to get -3y = -9, then divide by -3 to find y = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 6(x + 1) = 42, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 6 to get x + 1 = 7, then subtract 1 to find x = 6.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y in the equation 5y - 15 = 10.",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Add 15 to both sides to get 5y = 25, then divide by 5 to find y = 5.",

    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 9x + 27 = 0?",
    options: ["-4", "-3", "-2", "-1"],
    correctAnswer: "-3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 27 from both sides to get 9x = -27, then divide by 9 to find x = -3.",

    question: "If 2y + 8 = 4, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["-2", "-3", "-4", "-5"],
    correctAnswer: "-2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 8 from both sides to get 2y = -4, then divide by 2 to find y = -2.",
