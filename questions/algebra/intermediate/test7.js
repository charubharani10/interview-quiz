    question: "If 7x + 2 = 23, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 2 from both sides to get 7x = 21, then divide by 7 to find x = 3.",

    question: "Solve for y in the equation 8y - 32 = 0.",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Add 32 to both sides to get 8y = 32, then divide by 8 to find y = 4.",
  },

    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 3(x + 4) = 30?",
    options: ["6", "7", "8", "9"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 3 to get x + 4 = 10, then subtract 4 to find x = 6.",

    question: "If 4y + 12 = 20, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 12 from both sides to get 4y = 8, then divide by 4 to find y = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x: 2x - 4 = 10.",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "7",
    explanation:
      "Add 4 to both sides to get 2x = 14, then divide by 2 to find x = 7.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 11y - 22 = 0?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 22 to both sides to get 11y = 22, then divide by 11 to find y = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 3(x - 1) = 6, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 3 to get x - 1 = 2, then add 1 to find x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 10y + 30 = 100.",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "7",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 30 from both sides to get 10y = 70, then divide by 10 to find y = 7.",

    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 14 - 2x = 10?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 14 from both sides to get -2x = -4, then divide by -2 to find x = 2.",
  },

    question: "If 5y - 25 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Add 25 to both sides to get 5y = 25, then divide by 5 to find y = 5.",
