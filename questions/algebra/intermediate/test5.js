    question: "If 2x + 5 = 15, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 5 from both sides to get 2x = 10, then divide by 2 to find x = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 6y + 3 = 21.",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 3 from both sides to get 6y = 18, then divide by 6 to find y = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 7x - 14 = 0?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 14 to both sides to get 7x = 14, then divide by 7 to find x = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 5x + 10 = 35, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 10 from both sides to get 5x = 25, then divide by 5 to find x = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y in the equation 9y - 36 = 0.",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Add 36 to both sides to get 9y = 36, then divide by 9 to find y = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 10 - 2x = 4?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 10 from both sides to get -2x = -6, then divide by -2 to find x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 4y + 20 = 60, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["8", "9", "10", "11"],
    correctAnswer: "10",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 20 from both sides to get 4y = 40, then divide by 4 to find y = 10.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x: 8 - 2(x + 1) = 0.",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "First, simplify to get 8 - 2x - 2 = 0, which simplifies to 6 - 2x = 0. Then, 2x = 6, and x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 3y + 4 = 19, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4 from both sides to get 3y = 15, then divide by 3 to find y = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 2x - 8 = 4?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Add 8 to both sides to get 2x = 12, then divide by 2 to find x = 6.",
  },
