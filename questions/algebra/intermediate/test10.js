    question: "If 4x + 12 = 28, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 12 from both sides to get 4x = 16, then divide by 4 to find x = 4.",
  },

    question: "Solve for y in the equation 5y - 10 = 0.",
    options: ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 10 to both sides to get 5y = 10, then divide by 5 to find y = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 3(x - 2) = 9?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 3 to get x - 2 = 3, then add 2 to find x = 5.",

    question: "If 8y + 32 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["-3", "-4", "-5", "-6"],
    correctAnswer: "-4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 32 from both sides to get 8y = -32, then divide by 8 to find y = -4.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x: 6x - 30 = 0.",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Add 30 to both sides to get 6x = 30, then divide by 6 to find x = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 4y + 16 = 0?",
    options: ["-2", "-3", "-4", "-5"],
    correctAnswer: "-4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 16 from both sides to get 4y = -16, then divide by 4 to find y = -4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 7(x + 3) = 42, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 7 to get x + 3 = 6, then subtract 3 to find x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 15 - 3y = 0.",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 15 from both sides to get -3y = -15, then divide by -3 to find y = 5.",
  },

    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 12x + 36 = 0?",
    options: ["-3", "-2", "-1", "0"],
    correctAnswer: "-3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 36 from both sides to get 12x = -36, then divide by 12 to find x = -3.",
  },

    question: "If 2y - 6 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 6 to both sides to get 2y = 6, then divide by 2 to find y = 3.",
