    question: "If 6x + 18 = 0, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["-3", "-2", "-1", "0"],
    correctAnswer: "-3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 18 from both sides to get 6x = -18, then divide by 6 to find x = -3.",
  },

    question: "Solve for y in the equation 2y + 4 = 16.",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4 from both sides to get 2y = 12, then divide by 2 to find y = 6.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 3(x + 5) = 24?",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 3 to get x + 5 = 8, then subtract 5 to find x = 3.",
  },

    question: "If 10y - 50 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Add 50 to both sides to get 10y = 50, then divide by 10 to find y = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x in the equation 8x - 4 = 28.",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Add 4 to both sides to get 8x = 32, then divide by 8 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 3y + 15 = 0?",
    options: ["-5", "-6", "-7", "-8"],
    correctAnswer: "-5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 15 from both sides to get 3y = -15, then divide by 3 to find y = -5.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 4(x - 3) = 8, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 4 to get x - 3 = 2, then add 3 to find x = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 12y - 48 = 0.",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Add 48 to both sides to get 12y = 48, then divide by 12 to find y = 4.",
  },

    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 5x + 25 = 0?",
    options: ["-5", "-4", "-3", "-2"],
    correctAnswer: "-5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 25 from both sides to get 5x = -25, then divide by 5 to find x = -5.",

    question: "If 9y + 27 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["-3", "-2", "-1", "0"],
    correctAnswer: "-3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 27 from both sides to get 9y = -27, then divide by 9 to find y = -3.",
  },
