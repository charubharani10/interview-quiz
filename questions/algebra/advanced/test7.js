    options: ["2", "3", "4", "1"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 4x - 4 + 2 = 3x + 1, simplifying to 4x - 2 = 3x + 1, leading to x = 3.",

    options: ["3", "1", "2", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 5x + 10 = 3x + 18, leading to 2x = 8, thus x = 4.",

    question: "Solve for x in the equation: 7x - 2(2x + 1) = 9.",
    options: ["2", "4", "1", "3"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 7x - 4x - 2 = 9, leading to 3x - 2 = 9. Thus, x = 3.",

    options: ["2", "3", "1", "0"],
    correctAnswer: "0",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 9x + 6 = 9x + 6, which is always true, indicating x can be any value.",

    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 4x - 4 = 4x + 10, which leads to a contradiction, indicating no solution.",

    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 2x^2 - 8 = 0?",
    options: ["-2", "0", "2", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Factoring gives 2(x^2 - 4) = 0, leading to x^2 = 4, thus x = 2.",

    options: ["5", "4", "3", "2"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Solving the first equation for x gives x = 10 - 2y. Substituting into the second leads to 2(10 - 2y) - 3y = 5.",
