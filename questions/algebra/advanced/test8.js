      "If the quadratic equation 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 is solved using the quadratic formula, what are the possible values of x?",
    options: ["-1, 2.5", "1, -2.5", "-2.5, 1", "2.5, -1"],
    correctAnswer: "-1, 2.5",
    explanation:
      "Using the quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a leads to x = (-3 ± √(3² - 4*2*(-5))) / (2*2).",

    question:
      "What is the value of k if the roots of the equation x^2 - 4x + k = 0 are equal?",
    options: ["0", "2", "4", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "For equal roots, the discriminant must be zero. So, 4 - 4k = 0, thus k = 4.",

    question: "If 3x + 5y = 15 and 2x - 4y = -10, find the value of x + y.",
    options: ["0", "5", "10", "15"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Solving the equations simultaneously gives x = 5 and y = 0, so x + y = 5.",

    question:
      "What is the solution for x in the equation 4(x - 1) + 2 = 2(x + 5) - x?",
    options: ["4", "6", "2", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 4x - 4 + 2 = 2x + 10 - x, leading to 4x - 2 = x + 10, thus x = 6.",

    question: "If f(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 1, what is f(-2)?",
    options: ["5", "-7", "11", "-3"],
    correctAnswer: "-3",
    explanation:
      "Substituting -2 into the function gives f(-2) = 3(-2)² + 4(-2) - 1 = -3.",

    question: "Solve for x: 5(2x - 3) = 3(3x + 2).",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation: "Expanding gives 10x - 15 = 9x + 6, leading to x = 2.",

      "For what value of k will the line 2x + 3y = k pass through the point (1, 2)?",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation:
      "Substituting (1, 2) into the equation gives k = 2(1) + 3(2) = 8.",

    options: ["-2, 2", "2, 4", "-4, 4", "0, 4"],
    correctAnswer: "2, -2",
    explanation: "Factoring gives 5(x^2 - 4) = 0, leading to x = ±2.",
