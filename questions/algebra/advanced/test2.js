    question: "Solve the equation: x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0.",
    options: ["0", "1", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "This is a perfect square trinomial. Factor to (x - 3)(x - 3) = 0. Thus, x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 2x - 3y = 12 and y = x - 3, find the value of x.",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Substitute y in the first equation: 2x - 3(x - 3) = 12. Solve to get x = 6.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation: 3(x - 2) + 2 = 5x - 6?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Expand and simplify: 3x - 6 + 2 = 5x - 6. Thus, 3x - 4 = 5x - 6. Rearranging gives x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 5x + 4 = 3(x + 2), what is the value of x?",
    options: ["-1", "0", "1", "2"],
    correctAnswer: "-1",
    explanation:
      "Distribute and solve: 5x + 4 = 3x + 6. This simplifies to 2x = 2, giving x = -1.",

    question: "Solve for x: x^2 - 7x + 10 = 0.",
    options: ["2, 5", "1, 10", "3, 4", "0, 10"],
    correctAnswer: "2, 5",
    explanation:
      "Factor the equation to (x - 2)(x - 5) = 0. Therefore, x = 2 or x = 5.",

    question: "If x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0, what are the roots of the equation?",
    options: ["1, 5", "2, -3", "3, 2", "5, -1"],
    correctAnswer: "5, -1",
    explanation: "Factor to (x - 5)(x + 1) = 0. Thus, x = 5 or x = -1.",
  },
  {
    question: "Find the value of x in the equation: 2x/3 + 4 = 10.",
    options: ["5", "6", "8", "10"],
    correctAnswer: "9",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4 from both sides: 2x/3 = 6. Multiply both sides by 3 to get 2x = 18, then divide by 2 gives x = 9.",

    question: "Solve for y in the equation: 2y^2 - 3y - 5 = 0.",
    options: ["-1, 2", "-2, 1", "1, -2", "2, -5"],
    correctAnswer: "5, -2",
    explanation:
      "Using the quadratic formula, y = [-(-3) ± √((-3)^2 - 4*2*(-5))] / (2*2). This results in two solutions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation: 3x^2 - 12 = 0?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Factor to get 3(x^2 - 4) = 0, then (x - 2)(x + 2) = 0 gives x = 2 or x = -2.",

    question:
      "If the equation 4x + 5y = 20 is rearranged for y, what is the equation?",
    options: ["y = -4/5x + 4", "y = -5/4x + 5", "y = 4/5x + 5", "y = 5/4x + 5"],
    correctAnswer: "y = -4/5x + 4",
    explanation: "Rearranging gives 5y = 20 - 4x, thus y = -4/5x + 4.",
