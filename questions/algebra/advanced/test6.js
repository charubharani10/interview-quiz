    question: "If 2x - 3 = 5x + 6, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["-3", "3", "-2", "2"],
    correctAnswer: "-3",
    explanation:
      "Rearranging gives 2x - 5x = 6 + 3, leading to -3x = 9, thus x = -3.",

    question: "Solve for x: 5(x + 1) - 4(x - 2) = 3.",
    options: ["3", "2", "1", "0"],
    correctAnswer: "1",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 5x + 5 - 4x + 8 = 3, simplifying to x + 13 = 3. Thus, x = -10.",

    question: "Find the value of x in the equation: 7x + 5 = 3x + 17.",
    options: ["3", "2", "5", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Rearranging gives 7x - 3x = 17 - 5, leading to 4x = 12. Thus, x = 3.",

    question: "If x - 3y = 7 and 2x + 3y = 11, find the value of x.",
    options: ["5", "7", "3", "1"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Solving the first equation for x gives x = 7 + 3y. Substituting into the second equation leads to 2(7 + 3y) + 3y = 11, which simplifies to 14 + 6y + 3y = 11, giving 9y = -3, hence y = -1. Thus, x = 5.",

    question: "What is the solution of the equation 6x - 2(3x - 4) = 8?",
    options: ["4", "3", "2", "1"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 6x - 6x + 8 = 8, which leads to a true statement, indicating x can be any value; however, the most straightforward is to assume x = 4.",

    question: "Solve for x in the equation: 4x + 3 = 3(x - 2) + 5.",
    options: ["2", "3", "1", "0"],
    correctAnswer: "1",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 4x + 3 = 3x - 6 + 5. Thus, 4x + 3 = 3x - 1, leading to x = -4.",

    question: "What is the value of x if 8x - 2 = 6(x + 1)?",
    options: ["2", "3", "1", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 8x - 2 = 6x + 6. Rearranging leads to 2x = 8, thus x = 4.",

    question: "If 3(x - 2) + 4 = 2(x + 5), what is the value of x?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 3x - 6 + 4 = 2x + 10, simplifying to x - 2 = 10, leading to x = 12.",

    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0?",
    options: ["1, 6", "2, 3", "3, 2", "4, 5"],
    correctAnswer: "2, 3",
    explanation:
      "Factoring gives (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, resulting in the roots x = 2 and x = 3.",

    explanation:
      "Finding a common denominator gives 4x + 3x = 7, leading to 7x = 84, thus x = 12.",
