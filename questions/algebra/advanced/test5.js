    question: "Solve for x: 2(x - 3) + 3(x + 4) = 5.",
    options: ["-1", "1", "0", "2"],
    correctAnswer: "1",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 2x - 6 + 3x + 12 = 5. Thus, 5x + 6 = 5, leading to 5x = -1, so x = 1.",

    question: "What is the value of x if 7x - 3(2x + 4) = 5?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "3"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 7x - 6x - 12 = 5, which simplifies to x - 12 = 5, leading to x = 17.",

    question: "If x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0, find the roots of the equation.",
    options: ["2, 3", "1, 6", "3, 2", "5, 1"],
    correctAnswer: "2, 3",
    explanation:
      "Factoring gives (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, so the roots are x = 2 and x = 3.",

    question: "Solve the equation: 3(x - 1) + 2 = 4x + 5.",
    options: ["-1", "0", "2", "1"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 3x - 3 + 2 = 4x + 5, simplifying to -x - 1 = 5. Thus, x = -6.",

    question: "Find the value of x if 4x - 3(2x - 5) = 7.",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 4x - 6x + 15 = 7, simplifying to -2x + 15 = 7. Thus, x = 4.",

    question: "What is the solution of the equation 2x^2 - 8x = 0?",
    options: ["0, 4", "2, 4", "2, 0", "0, 2"],
    correctAnswer: "0, 4",
    explanation:
      "Factoring gives 2x(x - 4) = 0, leading to the roots x = 0 and x = 4.",

    question: "If 3x + 2y = 12 and y = x + 2, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Substituting y gives 3x + 2(x + 2) = 12, leading to 5x + 4 = 12. Thus, 5x = 8, so x = 2.",

    question: "What are the roots of the equation x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0?",
    options: ["-2, -2", "2, 2", "0, 4", "4, 0"],
    correctAnswer: "-2, -2",
    explanation:
      "This is a perfect square: (x + 2)^2 = 0, so the double root is x = -2.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 5x - 2(3x + 4) = -10, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["-1", "2", "0", "-2"],
    correctAnswer: "-2",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 5x - 6x - 8 = -10. Thus, -x - 8 = -10, leading to x = -2.",
