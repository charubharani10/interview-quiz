    question: "If a + b = 12 and ab = 32, what is the value of a^2 + b^2?",
    options: ["40", "48", "44", "36"],
    correctAnswer: "40",
    explanation:
      "Using the identity a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab, we get 12^2 - 2*32 = 144 - 64 = 80.",

    question: "Solve for x: 3(x - 2) + 4 = 2x + 6.",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Distributing gives 3x - 6 + 4 = 2x + 6. Rearranging leads to x = 4.",

    question: "What is the value of x if 4x^2 - 16 = 0?",
    options: ["4", "2", "0", "-2"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Factoring gives 4(x^2 - 4) = 0, which simplifies to (x - 2)(x + 2) = 0. Thus, x = 2 or x = -2.",

  {
    question: "If 3x - 5 = 4x + 7, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["-12", "11", "2", "-2"],
    correctAnswer: "-12",
    explanation:
      "Rearranging gives 3x - 4x = 7 + 5. Thus, -x = 12, leading to x = -12.",
  },
  {
    question: "If x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, find the value of x.",
    options: ["1", "0", "-1", "2"],
    correctAnswer: "-1",
    explanation:
      "This is a perfect square: (x + 1)^2 = 0, so the double root is x = -1.",
  },

    question: "Solve for x: 2(x + 3) - 4 = 10.",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 2x + 6 - 4 = 10. Thus, 2x + 2 = 10, so 2x = 8, leading to x = 4.",
  },

    question: "Find the roots of the equation x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0.",
    options: ["2, 4", "3, 3", "1, 5", "0, 8"],
    correctAnswer: "2, 4",
    explanation:
      "Factoring gives (x - 2)(x - 4) = 0, so the roots are x = 2 and x = 4.",

    question: "If x + y = 8 and xy = 15, find the value of x^2 + y^2.",
    options: ["49", "56", "50", "64"],
    correctAnswer: "64",
    explanation:
      "Using the identity x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy, we get 8^2 - 2*15 = 64 - 30 = 34.",

    question: "What is the value of x if x^3 - 8 = 0?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "1"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Factoring gives (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 4) = 0. The real root is x = 2.",
