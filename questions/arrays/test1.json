    {
      "question": "What is the time complexity of accessing an element at a given index in an array?",
      "options": [
        "O(n)",
        "O(log n)",
        "O(1)",
        "O(n^2)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "O(1)",
      "explanation": "Array access by index is O(1) because arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations. The memory address of any element can be calculated directly using its index, making access constant time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which operation would be most efficient on a sorted array?",
      "options": [
        "Linear search",
        "Binary search",
        "Bubble sort",
        "Insertion sort"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Binary search",
      "explanation": "Binary search is highly efficient on sorted arrays with O(log n) time complexity. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, making it much faster than linear search O(n) for large datasets."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the time complexity of inserting an element at the beginning of an array?",
      "options": [
        "O(1)",
        "O(log n)",
        "O(n)",
        "O(n^2)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "O(n)",
      "explanation": "Inserting at the beginning requires shifting all existing elements one position to the right to make space for the new element. This shifting operation takes O(n) time where n is the number of elements."
    },
    {
      "question": "In an array of size n, what is the index of the last element?",
      "options": [
        "n",
        "n-1",
        "n+1",
        "1"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "n-1",
      "explanation": "Arrays use zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index 0. Therefore, in an array of size n, the last element is at index n-1."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of these operations would modify the original array?",
      "options": [
        "slice()",
        "concat()",
        "splice()",
        "join()"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "splice()",
      "explanation": "splice() modifies the original array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements. Other methods like slice(), concat(), and join() return a new array or string without modifying the original."
