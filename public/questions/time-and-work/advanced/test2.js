    question:
      "A and B can do a work in 15 days and 20 days, respectively. If they work together for 6 days and then B leaves, how long will A take to complete the remaining work?",
    options: ["7 days", "8 days", "9 days", "10 days"],
    correctAnswer: "9 days",
    explanation:
      "In 6 days, A does (6/15) = 2/5 and B does (6/20) = 3/10. Together, they complete (2/5 + 3/10) = 7/10. Remaining work = 1 - 7/10 = 3/10. A alone will take (3/10) * 15 = 4.5 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A can complete a job in 12 days, while B can finish it in 16 days. If they work together for a certain period and then A leaves, how long will B take to finish the job if they worked together for 4 days?",
    options: ["8 days", "10 days", "12 days", "14 days"],
    correctAnswer: "10 days",
    explanation:
      "In 4 days, A does (4/12) = 1/3 and B does (4/16) = 1/4. Together, they complete (1/3 + 1/4) = 7/12. Remaining work = 1 - 7/12 = 5/12. B alone will take (5/12) * 16 = 6.67 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If A can do a piece of work in 30 days and B can do it in 20 days, how many days will they take together to finish the work?",
    options: ["12 days", "15 days", "20 days", "24 days"],
    correctAnswer: "12 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/30, B's rate = 1/20. Combined rate = (1/30 + 1/20) = 1/12. Thus, they will finish the work together in 12 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A can complete a job in 24 days, while B can do it in 18 days. If A works for 8 days and B for 4 days, how much of the job will be completed, and how many days will the remaining work take for A alone?",
    options: ["10 days", "12 days", "14 days", "16 days"],
    correctAnswer: "10 days",
    explanation:
      "In 8 days, A completes (8/24) = 1/3 and in 4 days, B completes (4/18) = 2/9. Together they complete (1/3 + 2/9) = 5/9. Remaining work = 1 - 5/9 = 4/9. A will take (4/9) * 24 = 10.67 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If A and B can complete a task in 20 days, and A alone can finish it in 30 days, how long can B finish it alone?",
    options: ["40 days", "45 days", "50 days", "60 days"],
    correctAnswer: "60 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/30. Combined rate = 1/20, thus B's rate = (1/20 - 1/30) = 1/60. Therefore, B can finish the work alone in 60 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A and B can complete a task in 24 days together, while A alone can complete it in 36 days. How long will B take to finish it alone?",
    options: ["48 days", "60 days", "72 days", "80 days"],
    correctAnswer: "72 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/36. Combined rate = 1/24, thus B's rate = (1/24 - 1/36) = 1/72. Therefore, B can finish the work alone in 72 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If A can finish a work in 10 days, B can finish it in 15 days, and C can finish it in 30 days, how long will it take if all three work together?",
    options: ["5 days", "6 days", "7 days", "8 days"],
    correctAnswer: "5 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/10, B's rate = 1/15, C's rate = 1/30. Combined rate = (1/10 + 1/15 + 1/30) = 1/5. Thus, they will finish the work together in 5 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If A can do a piece of work in 40 days and B can do it in 60 days, how long will they take to complete it together?",
    options: ["24 days", "30 days", "36 days", "40 days"],
    correctAnswer: "24 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/40, B's rate = 1/60. Combined rate = (1/40 + 1/60) = 1/24. Thus, they will finish the work together in 24 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A is twice as efficient as B. If A can complete a job in 18 days, how long will it take them to finish the work together?",
    options: ["12 days", "14 days", "16 days", "18 days"],
    correctAnswer: "12 days",
    explanation:
      "B's rate = 1/36 (since A is twice as efficient). Combined rate = (1/18 + 1/36) = 1/12. Thus, they will finish the work together in 12 days.",
  },
