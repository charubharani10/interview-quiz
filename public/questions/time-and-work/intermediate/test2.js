    options: ["10 days", "12 days", "15 days", "20 days"],
    correctAnswer: "10.8 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/18, B's rate = 1/27. Combined rate = (1/18 + 1/27) = 5/54. Thus, they will finish the work in 54/5 = 10.8 days.",

    question:
      "A can complete a job in 25 days, while B can do it in 40 days. If they work together for 10 days, how much of the work is left?",
    options: ["1/2", "1/4", "3/10", "2/5"],
    correctAnswer: "3/10",
    explanation:
      "In 10 days, A completes (10/25) = 2/5 and B completes (10/40) = 1/4 of the work. Together, they do (2/5 + 1/4) = 8/20 + 5/20 = 13/20. Remaining work = 1 - 13/20 = 7/20.",

      "If 5 workers can complete a job in 14 days, how long will it take for 7 workers to complete the same job?",
    options: ["9 days", "10 days", "12 days", "14 days"],
    correctAnswer: "10 days",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 5 workers * 14 days = 70 worker-days. For 7 workers, time required = 70/7 = 10 days.",

    correctAnswer: "1/3",
    explanation:
      "In 5 days, A does (5/15) = 1/3 and B does (5/20) = 1/4. Together, they complete (1/3 + 1/4) = 7/12. Remaining work = 1 - 7/12 = 5/12.",

    correctAnswer: "18 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/30, B's rate = 1/45. Combined rate = (1/30 + 1/45) = 1/18. Thus, they will finish the work together in 18 days.",

    correctAnswer: "16 men",
    explanation:
