      "If A can complete a work in 12 days and B can complete the same work in 15 days, how many days will they take to complete the work together?",
    options: ["6 days", "8 days", "10 days", "12 days"],
    correctAnswer: "6.8 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/12, B's rate = 1/15. Together they can do (1/12 + 1/15) = 1/8. Thus, they will complete the job in 1/(1/8) = 8 days.",

    question:
      "A and B can finish a work in 20 days and 30 days, respectively. If they work together for 10 days, how much work is left?",
    options: ["1/3", "1/4", "1/5", "1/6"],
    correctAnswer: "1/3",
    explanation:
      "In 10 days, A completes 10/20 = 1/2 and B completes 10/30 = 1/3. Together they complete 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 of the work, leaving 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.",

    correctAnswer: "4 days",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 5 men × 12 days = 60 man-days. Therefore, 15 men will take 60/15 = 4 days.",

    correctAnswer: "14 days",
    explanation:
      "In 6 days, A completes 6/18 = 1/3 of the work. The remaining work is 2/3. A and B's combined rate = 1/18 + 1/24 = 1/10. Thus, to complete 2/3 work: 2/3 ÷ (1/10) = 20/3 = 6.67 days. Total = 6 + 6.67 = 12.67 days.",

    correctAnswer: "6 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/25, B's rate = 1/20, C's rate = 1/15. Together they can do (1/25 + 1/20 + 1/15) = 1/6. Thus, they will complete the job in 1/(1/6) = 6 days.",

    options: ["6 workers", "8 workers", "10 workers", "12 workers"],
    correctAnswer: "8 workers",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 4 workers × 10 days = 40 worker-days. Therefore, to complete in 5 days, 40/5 = 8 workers are needed.",

    correctAnswer: "30 days",
    explanation:
      "In 10 days, A completes 10/30 = 1/3 of the work. The remaining work is 2/3. B's rate = 1/45. Therefore, to complete 2/3 work: 2/3 ÷ (1/45) = 30 days.",

    correctAnswer: "20 days",
    explanation:
      "In 18 days, A completes 18/36 = 1/2, and B completes 18/54 = 1/3. Together they complete 5/6 of the work, leaving 1/6. A's rate = 1/36, so to complete 1/6: (1/6) ÷ (1/36) = 6 days.",
