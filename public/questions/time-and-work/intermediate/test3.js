    question:
      "If A can do a piece of work in 10 days and B can do the same work in 15 days, how long will it take them to complete the work together?",
    options: ["6 days", "8 days", "5 days", "12 days"],
    correctAnswer: "6 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/10, B's rate = 1/15. Combined rate = (1/10 + 1/15) = 1/6. Thus, they will finish the work together in 6 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A takes 12 days to finish a work alone, while B takes 18 days. If they work together for 6 days, how much work is left?",
    options: ["1/4", "1/3", "1/2", "1/5"],
    correctAnswer: "1/4",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/12, B's rate = 1/18. In 6 days, they do (1/12 + 1/18) * 6 = (3/36 + 2/36) * 6 = 5/6 of the work. Remaining work = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If 8 workers can complete a job in 24 days, how many days will it take for 4 workers to finish the same job?",
    options: ["48 days", "60 days", "36 days", "72 days"],
    correctAnswer: "48 days",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 8 workers * 24 days = 192 worker-days. For 4 workers, time required = 192/4 = 48 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A can complete a job in 16 days, and B can do the same job in 24 days. If they work together for 8 days, how much work is remaining?",
    options: ["1/4", "1/3", "1/2", "1/5"],
    correctAnswer: "1/3",
    explanation:
      "In 8 days, A completes (8/16) = 1/2 of the work, and B completes (8/24) = 1/3 of the work. Together, they complete (1/2 + 1/3) = 5/6 of the work. Remaining work = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.",
  },

    question:
      "If 3 people can do a work in 15 days, how long will it take for 9 people to complete the same work?",
    options: ["5 days", "10 days", "15 days", "20 days"],
    correctAnswer: "5 days",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 3 people * 15 days = 45 person-days. For 9 people, time required = 45/9 = 5 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A and B can complete a task in 24 and 36 days, respectively. If they work together for 12 days, how much work is left?",
    options: ["1/3", "1/4", "1/6", "1/2"],
    correctAnswer: "1/2",
    explanation:
      "In 12 days, A does (12/24) = 1/2 of the work, and B does (12/36) = 1/3 of the work. Together, they do (1/2 + 1/3) = 5/6 of the work. Remaining work = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If A can finish a work in 40 days and B can finish it in 60 days, how long will they take together?",
    options: ["20 days", "24 days", "30 days", "36 days"],
    correctAnswer: "24 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/40, B's rate = 1/60. Combined rate = (1/40 + 1/60) = 1/24. Thus, they will complete the work together in 24 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If 10 men can do a piece of work in 12 days, how many men will be needed to complete the work in 6 days?",
    options: ["20 men", "18 men", "15 men", "12 men"],
    correctAnswer: "20 men",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 10 men * 12 days = 120 man-days. To complete it in 6 days, required men = 120/6 = 20 men.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A can complete a work in 15 days, and B is twice as efficient as A. How long will it take B to finish the work alone?",
    options: ["7.5 days", "10 days", "12 days", "5 days"],
    correctAnswer: "10 days",
    explanation:
      "Since B is twice as efficient, B's rate = 2/15. Therefore, B can finish the work alone in 15/2 = 7.5 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If A can finish a task in 20 days, B in 30 days, and C in 60 days, how long will they take to complete the work together?",
    options: ["10 days", "12 days", "15 days", "8 days"],
    correctAnswer: "8 days",
    explanation:
      "Combined rate = 1/20 + 1/30 + 1/60 = (3 + 2 + 1)/60 = 6/60 = 1/10. Thus, they will complete the work in 10 days.",
