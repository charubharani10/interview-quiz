    question:
      "If A can complete a task in 15 days and B can complete it in 10 days, how long will they take if A works alone for 5 days and then they both work together?",
    options: ["5 days", "10 days", "12 days", "15 days"],
    correctAnswer: "10 days",
    explanation:
      "In 5 days, A completes 5/15 = 1/3 of the work. The remaining work is 2/3. A's rate = 1/15 and B's rate = 1/10. Together, they work at a rate of (1/15 + 1/10) = 1/6. To complete the remaining 2/3 work: (2/3) ÷ (1/6) = 4 days. Total time = 5 + 4 = 9 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A and B together can finish a job in 24 days. If A alone can complete the job in 40 days, how long will B take to complete the job alone?",
    options: ["30 days", "40 days", "60 days", "80 days"],
    correctAnswer: "60 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/40, and their combined rate = 1/24. Thus, B's rate = (1/24 - 1/40) = (5/120 - 3/120) = 2/120 = 1/60. So, B takes 60 days to complete the work alone.",

    question:
      "If a man can do a piece of work in 20 days, how much work can he do in 5 days?",
    options: ["1/5", "1/4", "1/3", "1/2"],
    correctAnswer: "1/4",
    explanation:
      "In 20 days, the man completes 1 whole work, so in 5 days he will complete (5/20) = 1/4 of the work.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A can complete a work in 16 days, and B can complete it in 24 days. If they work together for 8 days, how much work is left?",
    options: ["1/4", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3"],
    correctAnswer: "1/3",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/16, B's rate = 1/24. Together, they can do (1/16 + 1/24) = 5/48 of the work in one day. In 8 days, they complete (5/48) * 8 = 5/6 of the work. Remaining work = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If 10 men can finish a job in 15 days, how many men will be needed to complete the job in 10 days?",
    options: ["12", "15", "18", "20"],
    correctAnswer: "15",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 10 men × 15 days = 150 man-days. To finish in 10 days, the number of men required = 150/10 = 15.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A can complete a task in 18 days, B can do it in 27 days. If they work together for 9 days, how much work is left?",
    options: ["1/4", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3"],
    correctAnswer: "1/2",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/18, B's rate = 1/27. Together they complete (1/18 + 1/27) = 5/54 of the work in one day. In 9 days, they complete (5/54) * 9 = 5/6 of the work. Remaining work = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If 8 workers can complete a task in 12 days, how many days will 6 workers take to finish the same task?",
    options: ["8 days", "10 days", "12 days", "16 days"],
    correctAnswer: "16 days",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 8 workers × 12 days = 96 worker-days. Therefore, for 6 workers: 96/6 = 16 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A can finish a work in 36 days, and B can finish it in 54 days. If they work together for 18 days, how much work is left?",
    options: ["1/4", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3"],
    correctAnswer: "1/2",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/36, B's rate = 1/54. Together they complete (1/36 + 1/54) = 5/108 of the work in one day. In 18 days, they complete (5/108) * 18 = 5/6 of the work. Remaining work = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If A is twice as efficient as B and they finish a job together in 18 days, how long will B take to finish the job alone?",
    options: ["36 days", "27 days", "54 days", "18 days"],
    correctAnswer: "36 days",
    explanation:
      "If A is twice as efficient as B, then if B takes x days, A takes x/2 days. Thus, 1/x + 2/x = 1/18. Solving gives x = 36 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A and B can finish a work in 12 days. If A works for 4 days and then B works alone, how long will it take for B to finish the remaining work?",
    options: ["6 days", "8 days", "10 days", "12 days"],
    correctAnswer: "8 days",
    explanation:
      "In 4 days, A completes 4/12 = 1/3 of the work. The remaining work is 2/3. B's rate = 1/12. Thus, to complete the remaining 2/3: (2/3) ÷ (1/12) = 8 days.",
