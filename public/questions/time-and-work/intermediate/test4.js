    question:
      "If A can complete a piece of work in 20 days and B can do it in 30 days, how long will they take to complete the work together?",
    options: ["12 days", "15 days", "10 days", "18 days"],
    correctAnswer: "12 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/20, B's rate = 1/30. Together, they work at a rate of (1/20 + 1/30) = 1/12. Therefore, they will complete the work together in 12 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A and B can do a job in 18 days and 27 days, respectively. If they work together for 6 days, how much work is left?",
    options: ["1/4", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3"],
    correctAnswer: "1/2",
    explanation:
      "In 6 days, A does 6/18 = 1/3 of the work, and B does 6/27 = 2/9 of the work. Together they do (1/3 + 2/9) = 5/9 of the work. Remaining work = 1 - 5/9 = 4/9.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If A alone can complete a work in 15 days and B alone in 10 days, how long will it take for both to complete the work together?",
    options: ["6 days", "8 days", "5 days", "4 days"],
    correctAnswer: "6 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/15, B's rate = 1/10. Their combined rate = (1/15 + 1/10) = 1/6. Thus, they will finish the work together in 6 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A can do a work in 24 days and B can do it in 36 days. If they work together for 12 days, how much work is left?",
    options: ["1/3", "1/4", "1/2", "1/6"],
    correctAnswer: "1/3",
    explanation:
      "In 12 days, A does 12/24 = 1/2 of the work, and B does 12/36 = 1/3 of the work. Together they do (1/2 + 1/3) = 5/6 of the work. Remaining work = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.",

    question:
      "If 5 workers can complete a task in 30 days, how many days will 10 workers take to finish the same task?",
    options: ["10 days", "15 days", "20 days", "25 days"],
    correctAnswer: "15 days",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 5 workers × 30 days = 150 worker-days. For 10 workers, time required = 150/10 = 15 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A and B can complete a job in 20 days and 30 days, respectively. If they work together for 10 days, how much work is remaining?",
    options: ["1/5", "1/4", "1/3", "1/2"],
    correctAnswer: "1/4",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/20, B's rate = 1/30. Their combined rate = (1/20 + 1/30) = 1/12. In 10 days, they do (1/12) * 10 = 5/6 of the work. Remaining work = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If A can finish a work in 25 days and B can finish it in 35 days, how long will it take for A and B to finish it together?",
    options: ["14.3 days", "20 days", "28 days", "15 days"],
    correctAnswer: "14.3 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/25, B's rate = 1/35. Combined rate = (1/25 + 1/35) = 7/175 = 1/25. So, they will complete the work together in 14.3 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A and B can finish a work in 15 days together. If A works alone for 5 days, and then B works alone for the next 5 days, how much work is left?",
    options: ["1/5", "2/5", "1/3", "1/4"],
    correctAnswer: "1/3",
    explanation:
      "In 5 days, A completes 5/15 = 1/3 of the work. In 5 days, B completes 5/15 = 1/3 of the work. Together, they complete 2/3. Remaining work = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If A is three times as efficient as B and together they complete a task in 10 days, how long will it take B to complete the task alone?",
    options: ["15 days", "20 days", "25 days", "30 days"],
    correctAnswer: "30 days",
    explanation:
      "Let B take x days to complete the task. Then A takes x/3 days. Therefore, (1/x) + (1/(x/3)) = 1/10. Solving gives x = 30 days.",

    question:
      "If 12 men can complete a work in 15 days, how many days will 9 men take to finish the same work?",
    options: ["17 days", "20 days", "25 days", "30 days"],
    correctAnswer: "20 days",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 12 men × 15 days = 180 man-days. For 9 men: 180/9 = 20 days.",
