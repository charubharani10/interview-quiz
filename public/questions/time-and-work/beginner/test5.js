    question:
      "If 6 men can complete a work in 8 days, how many days will it take for 3 men to complete the same work?",
    options: ["12 days", "16 days", "20 days", "24 days"],
    correctAnswer: "16 days",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 6 men × 8 days = 48 man-days. So, 3 men will take 48/3 = 16 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A can do a piece of work in 15 days, while B can do it in 20 days. How long will it take them to complete the work together?",
    options: ["8 days", "10 days", "12 days", "15 days"],
    correctAnswer: "8 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/15, B's rate = 1/20. Together they work at (1/15 + 1/20) = 7/60. Thus, they will complete the job in 60/7 ≈ 8.57 days, which can be approximated to 8 days.",

    question:
      "If a worker can paint a room in 10 hours, how much of the room can he paint in 2 hours?",
    options: ["1/5", "1/4", "1/3", "1/2"],
    correctAnswer: "1/5",
    explanation:
      "In 10 hours, the worker completes the whole room. In 2 hours, he completes 2/10 = 1/5 of the room.",
  },

    question:
      "If 4 workers can complete a task in 25 days, how many workers are needed to complete the task in 10 days?",
    options: ["6 workers", "8 workers", "10 workers", "12 workers"],
    correctAnswer: "10 workers",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 4 workers × 25 days = 100 worker-days. To finish in 10 days, needed workers = 100/10 = 10 workers.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A takes 12 days to finish a job alone, and B takes 18 days. If they work together, how long will it take them to complete the job?",
    options: ["5 days", "6 days", "7 days", "8 days"],
    correctAnswer: "7.2 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/12, B's rate = 1/18. Together they can do (1/12 + 1/18) = 5/36 of the work per day. Thus, they will complete the job in 36/5 = 7.2 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If 8 men can complete a work in 10 days, how long will it take for 2 men to complete the same work?",
    options: ["30 days", "40 days", "50 days", "60 days"],
    correctAnswer: "40 days",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 8 men × 10 days = 80 man-days. Therefore, 2 men will take 80/2 = 40 days.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A can complete a task in 24 hours. B works at half the speed of A. How long will it take both A and B to finish the task together?",
    options: ["8 hours", "12 hours", "16 hours", "18 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "16 hours",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/24, B's rate = 1/48. Together they work at (1/24 + 1/48) = 3/48 = 1/16. Therefore, they will complete the job in 16 hours.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If a machine can produce 100 units in 5 hours, how many units can it produce in 2 hours?",
    options: ["20 units", "30 units", "40 units", "50 units"],
    correctAnswer: "40 units",
    explanation:
      "The machine produces 100 units in 5 hours, which means it produces 20 units per hour. In 2 hours, it will produce 2 × 20 = 40 units.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If 5 workers can finish a task in 15 days, how long will it take for 10 workers to finish the same task?",
    options: ["5 days", "6 days", "7.5 days", "10 days"],
    correctAnswer: "7.5 days",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 5 workers × 15 days = 75 worker-days. Hence, 10 workers will complete it in 75/10 = 7.5 days.",

  {
    question:
      "A can do a piece of work in 8 days, while B can do it in 12 days. If they work together for 2 days, how much of the work is completed?",
    options: ["1/4", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3"],
    correctAnswer: "1/3",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/8, B's rate = 1/12. Together they complete (1/8 + 1/12) = 5/24 of the work in 1 day. In 2 days, they will complete 2 × 5/24 = 10/24 = 5/12 of the work.",
