      "If 10 men can complete a work in 15 days, how many days will 5 men take to complete the same work?",
    options: ["25 days", "30 days", "35 days", "40 days"],
    correctAnswer: "30 days",
    explanation:
      "Total work = 10 men × 15 days = 150 man-days. Therefore, 5 men will take 150/5 = 30 days.",

    options: ["10 days", "15 days", "20 days", "24 days"],
    correctAnswer: "12 days",
    explanation:
      "A's rate = 1/20, B's rate = 1/25. Together they can do (1/20 + 1/25) = 9/100 of the work per day. Thus, they will complete the job in 100/9 ≈ 11.11 days.",

    correctAnswer: "10 days",
    explanation:
