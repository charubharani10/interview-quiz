    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 3(x - 2) = 9?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 3: x - 2 = 3. Then add 2 to both sides to get x = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 2y + 4 = 12, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4 from both sides to get 2y = 8, then divide by 2 to find y = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x: 7x - 21 = 0.",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 21 to both sides to get 7x = 21, then divide by 7 to find x = 3.",
  },

    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 10 = 2(y + 3)?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 2: 5 = y + 3. Then subtract 3 from both sides to find y = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 6x + 9 = 21, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 9 from both sides to get 6x = 12, then divide by 6 to find x = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 4(x - 5) = 8?",
    options: ["8", "9", "10", "11"],
    correctAnswer: "7",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 4: x - 5 = 2. Then add 5 to both sides to get x = 7.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 5y = 45.",
    options: ["8", "9", "10", "11"],
    correctAnswer: "9",
    explanation: "Divide both sides by 5 to find y: y = 45 / 5 = 9.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 9x - 36 = 0?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Add 36 to both sides to get 9x = 36, then divide by 9 to find x = 4.",
  },

    question: "If 12 + 3y = 21, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 12 from both sides to get 3y = 9, then divide by 3 to find y = 3.",

    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 10 to both sides to get 5x = 10, then divide by 5 to find x = 2.",
