    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 7x = 42?",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation: "Divide both sides by 7 to find x = 42 / 7 = 6.",

    question: "If 5x + 15 = 30, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 15 from both sides to get 5x = 15, then divide by 5 to find x = 3.",

    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 2y + 5 = 17?",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 5 from both sides to get 2y = 12, then divide by 2 to find y = 6.",

    question: "Solve for x: 4(x + 3) = 28.",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 4: x + 3 = 7. Then subtract 3 from both sides to get x = 4.",
  },

    question: "If 3y - 12 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Add 12 to both sides to get 3y = 12, then divide by 3 to find y = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 6x + 9 = 21?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 9 from both sides to get 6x = 12, then divide by 6 to find x = 2.",
  },

    question: "If 5y + 10 = 40, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 10 from both sides to get 5y = 30, then divide by 5 to find y = 6.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 2(x + 5) = 18?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 2: x + 5 = 9. Then subtract 5 from both sides to get x = 4.",

    question: "If 8y - 16 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 16 to both sides to get 8y = 16, then divide by 8 to find y = 2.",

    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 12 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then divide by 3 to find x = 5.",
