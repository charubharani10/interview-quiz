    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 8 = 2(x + 1)?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 2: 4 = x + 1. Then subtract 1 from both sides to get x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 5x + 20 = 40, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 20 from both sides to get 5x = 20, then divide by 5 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for y in the equation 2y - 6 = 0?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 6 to both sides to get 2y = 6, then divide by 2 to find y = 3.",

    question: "Solve for x in the equation x/3 + 5 = 9.",
    options: ["9", "12", "15", "18"],
    correctAnswer: "12",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 5 from both sides to get x/3 = 4, then multiply by 3 to find x = 12.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 4y + 8 = 32, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 8 from both sides to get 4y = 24, then divide by 4 to find y = 6.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 3x + 3 = 15?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 3 from both sides to get 3x = 12, then divide by 3 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 6x - 12 = 0, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 12 to both sides to get 6x = 12, then divide by 6 to find x = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y in the equation 10y + 20 = 100.",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 20 from both sides to get 10y = 80, then divide by 10 to find y = 8.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 2(x - 4) = 10?",
    options: ["7", "8", "9", "10"],
    correctAnswer: "9",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 2: x - 4 = 5. Then add 4 to both sides to get x = 9.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 3x + 6 = 18, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 6 from both sides to get 3x = 12, then divide by 3 to find x = 4.",
