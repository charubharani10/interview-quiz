    question: "If 3x + 4 = 19, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then divide by 3 to find x = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x in the equation 2(3x - 4) = 10.",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 2 to get 3x - 4 = 5, then add 4 to both sides to get 3x = 9, and finally divide by 3 to find x = 3.",
  },

    question: "What is the solution for y in the equation 4y - 8 + 2 = 0?",
    options: ["-2", "-1", "0", "1"],
    correctAnswer: "-1",
    explanation:
      "Combine like terms to get 4y - 6 = 0, then add 6 to both sides to get 4y = 6, and divide by 4 to find y = -1.",
  },

    question: "If 5(2x - 1) = 4x + 11, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Expand the left side to get 10x - 5 = 4x + 11. Subtract 4x from both sides to get 6x - 5 = 11. Add 5 to both sides to get 6x = 16, then divide by 6 to find x = 6.",

  {
    question: "Solve for y: 2y + 3(4 - y) = 9.",
    options: ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Distribute 3 to get 2y + 12 - 3y = 9. Combine like terms to get -y + 12 = 9. Subtract 12 from both sides to get -y = -3, then multiply by -1 to find y = 3.",
  },

    question: "If 2(x + 3) - 3(x - 2) = 7, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Expand to get 2x + 6 - 3x + 6 = 7. Combine like terms to get -x + 12 = 7. Subtract 12 from both sides to get -x = -5, then multiply by -1 to find x = 5.",

    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 4(x - 1) = 3(x + 2)?",
    options: ["-1", "0", "1", "2"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Expand to get 4x - 4 = 3x + 6. Subtract 3x from both sides to get x - 4 = 6. Add 4 to both sides to find x = 10.",

    options: ["0, 4", "1, 4", "2, 4", "3, 4"],
    correctAnswer: "0, 4",
    explanation:
      "Factor out 2x to get 2x(x - 4) = 0. Set each factor to zero: 2x = 0 or x - 4 = 0, giving x = 0 or x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 3y^2 - 12y + 9 = 0.",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Factor the quadratic to get (3y - 3)(y - 3) = 0. Set each factor to zero: 3y - 3 = 0 or y - 3 = 0, giving y = 1 or y = 3.",

    question: "If (x + 5)(x - 3) = 0, what are the possible values of x?",
    options: ["-5, 3", "-3, 5", "5, -5", "3, -5"],
    correctAnswer: "-5, 3",
    explanation:
      "Set each factor to zero: x + 5 = 0 gives x = -5 and x - 3 = 0 gives x = 3.",
