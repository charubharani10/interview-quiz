    question: "If 3x + 5 = 2x + 10, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["5", "3", "2", "1"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation: "Rearranging gives 3x - 2x = 10 - 5, leading to x = 5.",

    question:
      "Find the value of k if the roots of the equation x^2 - kx + 16 = 0 are both integers.",
    options: ["8", "10", "12", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation:
      "The sum of the roots must be k, and the product must be 16. The pairs (4, 4) lead to k = 8.",

    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 5x - 7(2x - 3) = 6?",
    options: ["-1", "1", "2", "0"],
    correctAnswer: "1",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 5x - 14x + 21 = 6, leading to -9x + 21 = 6, thus x = 1.",

    question:
      "If the equation 2x^2 - 4x + k = 0 has no real roots, what is the minimum value of k?",
    options: ["0", "1", "2", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "The discriminant must be less than zero: (-4)^2 - 4(2)(k) < 0, leading to k > 4.",

    question: "Solve for y: 3(y + 2) - 2(y - 1) = 5.",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "0"],
    correctAnswer: "1",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 3y + 6 - 2y + 2 = 5, thus y + 8 = 5, leading to y = 1.",

    question:
      "If the quadratic equation x^2 - 4x + m = 0 has one repeated root, find the value of m.",
    options: ["4", "8", "0", "16"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Setting the discriminant to zero gives (-4)^2 - 4(1)(m) = 0, thus m = 4.",

    question: "What is the value of x if 6(2x - 1) = 3(4x + 5)?",
    options: ["1", "0", "2", "3"],
    correctAnswer: "1",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 12x - 6 = 12x + 15, which simplifies to -6 = 15, so x = 1.",

    question: "If f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 5, what is f(3)?",
    options: ["2", "5", "8", "10"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation: "Substituting 3 gives f(3) = 2(3^2) - 3(3) + 5 = 8.",

    options: ["0", "2", "1", "3"],
    correctAnswer: "0",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 4x - 8 = 6x + 2, leading to -2x = 10, thus x = 0.",
