    question: "If 2x + 3 = 5x - 12, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "5", "2", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Rearranging gives 3 + 12 = 5x - 2x, leading to 15 = 3x, thus x = 5.",

    question:
      "What is the value of k in the equation 3x^2 + kx + 4 = 0 if the roots are 2 and -2?",
    options: ["-12", "8", "0", "-8"],
    correctAnswer: "-12",
    explanation:
      "Using Vieta's formulas, k = -(sum of roots) = -(2 + -2) = -12.",

    question: "Find the value of x in the equation 7 - 2(3x - 1) = 5.",
    options: ["1", "0", "2", "3"],
    correctAnswer: "1",
    explanation:
      "Expanding gives 7 - 6x + 2 = 5, leading to 9 - 6x = 5, thus x = 1.",

    question:
      "If the quadratic equation x^2 - 6x + k = 0 has roots that are equal, what is the value of k?",
    options: ["9", "36", "25", "16"],
    correctAnswer: "9",
    explanation:
      "Setting the discriminant to zero, we have (-6)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 0, thus k = 9.",

    question: "If f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2, what is the value of f(-1)?",
    options: ["0", "2", "-2", "-1"],
    correctAnswer: "0",
    explanation: "Substituting -1 gives f(-1) = (-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 2 = 0.",
