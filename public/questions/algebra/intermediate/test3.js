    question: "If 5x + 2 = 17, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 2 from both sides to get 5x = 15, then divide by 5 to find x = 3.",
  },

    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 3y - 5 = 7?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Add 5 to both sides to get 3y = 12, then divide by 3 to find y = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 4(x - 3) = 16, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["7", "8", "9", "10"],
    correctAnswer: "7",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 4: x - 3 = 4. Then add 3 to both sides to get x = 7.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x in the equation 2x^2 - 8 = 0.",
    options: ["2", "4", "6", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 8 to both sides to get 2x^2 = 8, then divide by 2 to find x^2 = 4. Taking the square root gives x = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 6y + 12 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["-1", "-2", "-3", "-4"],
    correctAnswer: "-2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 12 from both sides to get 6y = -12, then divide by 6 to find y = -2.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 4x + 2 = 18?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 2 from both sides to get 4x = 16, then divide by 4 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 7x - 14 = 0, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 14 to both sides to get 7x = 14, then divide by 7 to find x = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 3(y + 2) = 18.",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 3: y + 2 = 6. Then subtract 2 from both sides to get y = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 10 - 2x = 4, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 10 from both sides to get -2x = -6, then divide by -2 to find x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 5(x + 1) = 25?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 5: x + 1 = 5. Then subtract 1 from both sides to get x = 4.",
  },
