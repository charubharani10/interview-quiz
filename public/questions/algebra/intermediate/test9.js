    question: "If 15 - 3x = 0, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 15 from both sides to get -3x = -15, then divide by -3 to find x = 5.",
  },

    question: "Solve for y in the equation 7y + 14 = 0.",
    options: ["-2", "-1", "0", "1"],
    correctAnswer: "-2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 14 from both sides to get 7y = -14, then divide by 7 to find y = -2.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 4x - 8 = 0?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 8 to both sides to get 4x = 8, then divide by 4 to find x = 2.",
  },

    question: "If 5y + 20 = 45, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 20 from both sides to get 5y = 25, then divide by 5 to find y = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x: 2(x + 6) = 20.",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 2 to get x + 6 = 10, then subtract 6 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 6y + 36 = 0?",
    options: ["-6", "-5", "-4", "-3"],
    correctAnswer: "-6",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 36 from both sides to get 6y = -36, then divide by 6 to find y = -6.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 2x + 5 = 13, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 5 from both sides to get 2x = 8, then divide by 2 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 9 - 3y = 0.",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 9 from both sides to get -3y = -9, then divide by -3 to find y = 3.",
  },

    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 10x + 20 = 0?",
    options: ["-2", "-1", "0", "1"],
    correctAnswer: "-2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 20 from both sides to get 10x = -20, then divide by 10 to find x = -2.",
  },

    question: "If 3y - 9 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 9 to both sides to get 3y = 9, then divide by 3 to find y = 3.",
