    question: "If 8x - 16 = 0, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 16 to both sides to get 8x = 16, then divide by 8 to find x = 2.",
  },

    question: "Solve for y in the equation 5y + 15 = 0.",
    options: ["-3", "-2", "-1", "0"],
    correctAnswer: "-3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 15 from both sides to get 5y = -15, then divide by 5 to find y = -3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 3x - 9 = 0?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 9 to both sides to get 3x = 9, then divide by 3 to find x = 3.",
  },

    question: "If 4x + 8 = 24, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 8 from both sides to get 4x = 16, then divide by 4 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 7y - 21 = 0.",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 21 to both sides to get 7y = 21, then divide by 7 to find y = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 9x + 3 = 30?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 3 from both sides to get 9x = 27, then divide by 9 to find x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 2y + 4 = 10, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4 from both sides to get 2y = 6, then divide by 2 to find y = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x in the equation 6x - 12 = 0.",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Add 12 to both sides to get 6x = 12, then divide by 6 to find x = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 3(x - 1) = 12, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 3: x - 1 = 4. Then add 1 to both sides to get x = 5.",
  },

    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 4y + 16 = 48?",
    options: ["6", "7", "8", "9"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 16 from both sides to get 4y = 32, then divide by 4 to find y = 8.",
