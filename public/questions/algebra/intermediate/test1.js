    question: "If 3x + 4 = 19, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4 from both sides to get 3x = 15, then divide by 3 to find x = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y in the equation 2(y - 3) = 14.",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "10",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 2: y - 3 = 7. Then add 3 to both sides to get y = 10.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 5x + 15 = 0?",
    options: ["-3", "-2", "-1", "0"],
    correctAnswer: "-3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 15 from both sides to get 5x = -15, then divide by 5 to find x = -3.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 4(x + 2) = 28, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 4: x + 2 = 7. Then subtract 2 from both sides to get x = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x in the equation 2x^2 - 8 = 0.",
    options: ["2", "4", "6", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Add 8 to both sides to get 2x^2 = 8, then divide by 2 to find x^2 = 4. Taking the square root gives x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 7y + 5 = 26, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 5 from both sides to get 7y = 21, then divide by 7 to find y = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 3(x - 1) = 12?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "5",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 3: x - 1 = 4. Then add 1 to both sides to get x = 5.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 5x - 3 = 2x + 9, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 2x from both sides to get 3x - 3 = 9. Then add 3 to both sides to get 3x = 12, and divide by 3 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for y: 8y - 16 = 32.",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Add 16 to both sides to get 8y = 48, then divide by 8 to find y = 6.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of x in the equation 6x + 2 = 5x + 20?",
    options: ["15", "16", "17", "18"],
    correctAnswer: "18",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 5x from both sides to get x + 2 = 20. Then subtract 2 from both sides to find x = 18.",
  },
