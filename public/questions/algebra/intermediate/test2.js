    question: "If 9x - 4 = 50, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Add 4 to both sides to get 9x = 54, then divide by 9 to find x = 6.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x in the equation 3x^2 - 27 = 0.",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 27 to both sides to get 3x^2 = 27, then divide by 3 to find x^2 = 9. Taking the square root gives x = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the value of y in the equation 2y + 3 = 7?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 3 from both sides to get 2y = 4, then divide by 2 to find y = 2.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 4(x + 1) = 20, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 4: x + 1 = 5. Then subtract 1 from both sides to get x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x in the equation 5(x - 2) = 10.",
    options: ["2", "4", "6", "8"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "Divide both sides by 5: x - 2 = 2. Then add 2 to both sides to get x = 6.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 10y + 20 = 60, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 20 from both sides to get 10y = 40, then divide by 10 to find y = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the solution for x in the equation 7x - 3 = 4x + 9?",
    options: ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4x from both sides to get 3x - 3 = 9. Then add 3 to both sides to get 3x = 12, and divide by 3 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 6y - 18 = 0, what is the value of y?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation:
      "Add 18 to both sides to get 6y = 18, then divide by 6 to find y = 3.",
  },
  {
    question: "Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 5x - 9.",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 2x from both sides to get 3 = 3x - 9. Then add 9 to both sides to get 12 = 3x, and divide by 3 to find x = 4.",
  },
  {
    question: "If 8x + 4 = 36, what is the value of x?",
    options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
    correctAnswer: "4",
    explanation:
      "Subtract 4 from both sides to get 8x = 32, then divide by 8 to find x = 4.",
