      "In a class of 30 students, the average score in a math exam is 85. If 5 students scored 95, what is the average score of the remaining students?",
    options: ["80", "82", "83", "84"],
    correctAnswer: "84",
    explanation:
      "Total score = 30 * 85 = 2550. Total score of 5 students = 5 * 95 = 475. Remaining score = 2550 - 475 = 2075. Average of remaining 25 students = 2075 / 25 = 83.",

      "A store sells 100 items with an average price of $20. If 10 items are sold for $30 each, what is the new average price of the remaining items?",
    options: ["$18", "$19", "$20", "$21"],
    correctAnswer: "$19",
    explanation:
      "Total revenue = 100 * 20 = $2000. Revenue from 10 items = 10 * 30 = $300. New total revenue = 2000 - 300 = 1700. Remaining items = 90. New average = 1700 / 90 = $18.89.",

    options: ["68", "70", "72", "74"],
    correctAnswer: "68",
    explanation:
      "Total weight = 10 * 70 = 700 kg. New total weight after exclusion = 9 * 72 = 648 kg. Weight of excluded person = 700 - 648 = 52 kg.",

    options: ["12", "12.5", "13", "13.5"],
    correctAnswer: "12",
    explanation:
      "Time for first half = 30/10 = 3 hours; Time for second half = 30/15 = 2 hours. Total time = 3 + 2 = 5 hours. Average speed = 60/5 = 12 km/h.",

    correctAnswer: "12",
    explanation:
      "Total fuel for Car 1 = 10 * 1.5 = 15 liters; Car 2 = 12 * 1.5 = 18 liters; Car 3 = 15 * 1.5 = 22.5 liters. Total = 15 + 18 + 22.5 = 55. Overall average = 55 / 3 = 18.33.",

    correctAnswer: "90",
    explanation:
      "Total score = 25 * 75 = 1875. New total score after new student = 26 * 78 = 2028. Score of new student = 2028 - 1875 = 153.",

    correctAnswer: "210",
    explanation:
      "Initial total weight = 200 * 15 = 3000 grams. Added weight = 5 * 250 = 1250 grams. New total weight = 3000 + 1250 = 4250 grams. New average = 4250 / 20 = 212.5 grams.",
