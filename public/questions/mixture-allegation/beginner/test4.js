      "A mixture of two liquids contains 80% liquid A and 20% liquid B. If you have 50 liters of the mixture, how much of liquid A is there?",
    options: ["30 liters", "35 liters", "40 liters", "45 liters"],
    correctAnswer: "40 liters",
    explanation:
      "Amount of liquid A = 80% of 50 liters = 0.80 * 50 = 40 liters.",

    options: ["20%", "22%", "24%", "26%"],
    correctAnswer: "21%",
    explanation:
      "Total sugar = (0.25 * 12) + (0.15 * 8) = 3 + 1.2 = 4.2 liters; Total mixture = 12 + 8 = 20 liters; Percentage = (4.2/20) * 100 = 21%.",

    options: ["25%", "30%", "33.33%", "40%"],
    correctAnswer: "25%",
    explanation:
      "Total mixture = 5 liters + 15 liters = 20 liters; Percentage of juice = (5/20) * 100 = 25%.",
