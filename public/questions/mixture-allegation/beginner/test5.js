    question:
      "A chemist mixes 20 liters of a solution that is 50% acid with 10 liters of a solution that is 30% acid. What is the percentage of acid in the new mixture?",
    options: ["35%", "40%", "45%", "50%"],
    correctAnswer: "42.86%",
    explanation:
      "Total acid = (0.50 * 20) + (0.30 * 10) = 10 + 3 = 13 liters; Total mixture = 20 + 10 = 30 liters; Percentage = (13/30) * 100 = 43.33%.",
