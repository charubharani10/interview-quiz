    options: ["1 liter", "1.2 liters", "1.5 liters", "2 liters"],
    correctAnswer: "1.2 liters",
    explanation: "Amount of sugar = 30% of 4 liters = 0.30 * 4 = 1.2 liters.",

      "If a mixture consists of 5 parts of liquid A and 3 parts of liquid B, what is the percentage of liquid A in the mixture?",
    options: ["62.5%", "50%", "40%", "30%"],
    correctAnswer: "62.5%",
    explanation:
      "Total parts = 5 + 3 = 8; Percentage of liquid A = (5/8) * 100 = 62.5%.",

    options: ["3:2", "2:3", "3:4", "1:4"],
    correctAnswer: "3:4",
    explanation:
      "Total mixture = 6 liters + 2 liters = 8 liters; Ratio of fruit juice = 6:8 = 3:4.",
