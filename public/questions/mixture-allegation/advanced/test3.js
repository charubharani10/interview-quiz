    question:
      "A merchant mixes two types of tea costing $4 per kg and $6 per kg in the ratio of 3:2. If he prepares 50 kg of the mixture, what will be the cost of the mixture per kg?",
    options: ["$4.80", "$5.20", "$5.60", "$5.00"],
    correctAnswer: "$5.20",
    explanation:
      "Cost from tea 1 = (3/5) * 50 * 4 = $30. Cost from tea 2 = (2/5) * 50 * 6 = $60. Total cost = 30 + 60 = $90. Cost per kg = 90/50 = $5.20.",

    question:
      "A school has a mixture of students studying Mathematics and Science in the ratio of 5:3. If there are 240 students in total, how many students are studying Mathematics?",
    options: ["150", "120", "100", "80"],
    correctAnswer: "150",
    explanation:
      "Let the number of Mathematics students be 5x and Science students be 3x. Then, 5x + 3x = 240. Solving gives x = 30, so Mathematics students = 5 * 30 = 150.",

    question:
      "In a certain mixture, the ratio of milk to water is 2:3. If the total volume of the mixture is 250 liters, how much milk is there in the mixture?",
    options: ["70 liters", "80 liters", "100 liters", "120 liters"],
    correctAnswer: "100 liters",
    explanation:
      "Let the total parts = 2 + 3 = 5. Milk = (2/5) * 250 = 100 liters.",

    question:
      "A grocer has 80 kg of a mixture containing 25% sugar and 120 kg of a mixture containing 15% sugar. What will be the percentage of sugar in the final mixture?",
    options: ["20%", "22.5%", "18.75%", "23%"],
    correctAnswer: "20%",
    explanation:
      "Sugar in first mixture = 0.25 * 80 = 20 kg. Sugar in second mixture = 0.15 * 120 = 18 kg. Total sugar = 20 + 18 = 38 kg. Total mixture = 80 + 120 = 200 kg. Percentage = (38/200) * 100 = 19%.",

    question:
      "A solution contains 60% vinegar. If 25 liters of this solution is mixed with 15 liters of pure vinegar, what will be the final concentration of vinegar in the mixture?",
    options: ["72.5%", "75%", "70%", "74%"],
    correctAnswer: "72.5%",
    explanation:
      "In 25 liters of the solution, vinegar = 0.60 * 25 = 15 liters. When mixed with 15 liters of pure vinegar, total vinegar = 15 + 15 = 30 liters. Total volume = 25 + 15 = 40 liters. Concentration = (30/40) * 100 = 75%.",

    question:
      "A chemist has a 40% solution and a 60% solution. If he needs to prepare 50 liters of a 50% solution, how many liters of each solution should he use?",
    options: [
      "25 liters of each",
      "20 liters of 40% and 30 liters of 60%",
      "30 liters of 40% and 20 liters of 60%",
      "15 liters of 40% and 35 liters of 60%",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "20 liters of 40% and 30 liters of 60%",
    explanation:
      "Let x be the liters of 40% solution and y be the liters of 60% solution. We have x + y = 50 and 0.40x + 0.60y = 0.50 * 50. Solving gives x = 20 and y = 30.",

    question:
      "Two types of nuts are mixed in the ratio of 1:4. If 10 kg of the first type costs $8 per kg and the second type costs $6 per kg, what is the cost of the mixture per kg?",
    options: ["$6.40", "$6.80", "$7.00", "$7.20"],
    correctAnswer: "$6.40",
    explanation:
      "First type = 2 kg, Cost = 2 * 8 = $16; Second type = 8 kg, Cost = 8 * 6 = $48. Total cost = 16 + 48 = $64. Cost per kg = 64 / 10 = $6.40.",

    question:
      "A mixture consists of two types of alloys, A and B, in the ratio 3:5. If the total weight of the mixture is 64 kg, how much of alloy A is there in the mixture?",
    options: ["24 kg", "30 kg", "36 kg", "40 kg"],
    correctAnswer: "24 kg",
    explanation:
      "Let the parts of A = 3x and B = 5x. Then, 3x + 5x = 64 kg. Solving gives x = 8, so A = 3 * 8 = 24 kg.",

    question:
      "A solution contains 10% sugar. If 20 liters of this solution is mixed with 5 liters of pure sugar, what will be the final concentration of sugar in the mixture?",
    options: ["20%", "25%", "15%", "30%"],
    correctAnswer: "25%",
    explanation:
      "In 20 liters of the solution, sugar = 0.10 * 20 = 2 liters. Adding 5 liters of pure sugar gives total sugar = 2 + 5 = 7 liters. Total volume = 20 + 5 = 25 liters. Concentration = (7/25) * 100 = 28%.",

    question:
      "A seller mixes two varieties of rice, one costing $10 per kg and the other costing $15 per kg. If he wants to make a mixture costing $12 per kg, how many kg of each variety should he use to make a 40 kg mixture?",
