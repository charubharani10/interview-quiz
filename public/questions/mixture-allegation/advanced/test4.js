    question:
      "A container holds a mixture of 80 liters of alcohol and water in the ratio of 3:2. How much water should be added to make the ratio of alcohol to water 1:1?",
    options: ["20 liters", "30 liters", "25 liters", "15 liters"],
    correctAnswer: "40 liters",
    explanation:
      "Currently, alcohol = (3/5) * 80 = 48 liters and water = (2/5) * 80 = 32 liters. To make the ratio 1:1, we need to add enough water to equal the alcohol amount, so we need to add 48 - 32 = 16 liters.",

    question:
      "A mixture contains 40% sugar and 60% water. If 30 liters of this mixture is diluted by adding 10 liters of water, what is the new concentration of sugar in the mixture?",
    options: ["35%", "28%", "40%", "30%"],
    correctAnswer: "30%",
    explanation:
      "Sugar in 30 liters = 0.40 * 30 = 12 liters. After adding 10 liters of water, total volume = 30 + 10 = 40 liters. New concentration = (12/40) * 100 = 30%.",

    question:
      "A shopkeeper has two types of fruit, type A costing $2 per kg and type B costing $5 per kg. If he wants to create a mixture of 50 kg costing $3.50 per kg, how many kg of each type should he use?",
    options: [
      "20 kg of A and 30 kg of B",
      "25 kg of A and 25 kg of B",
      "30 kg of A and 20 kg of B",
      "35 kg of A and 15 kg of B",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "20 kg of A and 30 kg of B",
    explanation:
      "Let x kg be the amount of type A and y kg be type B. We have x + y = 50 and 2x + 5y = 3.5 * 50. Solving gives x = 20 kg of A and y = 30 kg of B.",

  {
    question:
      "A mixture of two liquids A and B is in the ratio of 7:3. If 5 liters of liquid A is added to the mixture, the ratio becomes 4:3. What was the initial quantity of liquid A?",
    options: ["21 liters", "28 liters", "35 liters", "42 liters"],
    correctAnswer: "28 liters",
    explanation:
      "Let the initial quantities be 7x and 3x. After adding 5 liters of A, we have (7x + 5) / 3x = 4/3. Solving gives x = 4, so A = 7 * 4 = 28 liters.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A school has a mixture of boys and girls in the ratio 3:2. If 15 more girls join the school, the ratio changes to 3:5. How many boys were initially in the school?",
    options: ["30", "45", "15", "25"],
    correctAnswer: "30",
    explanation:
      "Let the number of boys = 3x and girls = 2x. After 15 girls join, we have 3x/(2x + 15) = 3/5. Solving gives x = 10, so boys = 3 * 10 = 30.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "In a mixture of 50 liters, the ratio of A to B is 2:3. If 5 liters of A is removed and replaced with 5 liters of B, what is the new ratio of A to B?",
    options: ["1:2", "2:3", "3:4", "3:5"],
    correctAnswer: "2:5",
    explanation:
      "Initial amounts are A = (2/5)*50 = 20 liters, B = (3/5)*50 = 30 liters. After removing 5 liters of A, A = 20 - 5 = 15 liters. Adding 5 liters of B, B = 30 + 5 = 35 liters. New ratio = 15:35 = 2:5.",

    question:
      "A chemist mixes two solutions, one with 30% acid and the other with 50% acid. If he wants to make 100 liters of a solution that is 40% acid, how many liters of each solution should he mix?",
    options: [
      "40 liters of 30% and 60 liters of 50%",
      "60 liters of 30% and 40 liters of 50%",
      "50 liters of each",
      "30 liters of 30% and 70 liters of 50%",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "40 liters of 30% and 60 liters of 50%",
    explanation:
      "Let x be the liters of 30% solution and y be the liters of 50% solution. We have x + y = 100 and 0.30x + 0.50y = 0.40 * 100. Solving gives x = 40 and y = 60.",

    question:
      "A farmer mixes two types of seeds in the ratio of 4:1. If the total weight of the mixture is 75 kg, how much does each type of seed weigh?",
    options: [
      "60 kg and 15 kg",
      "50 kg and 25 kg",
      "40 kg and 35 kg",
      "30 kg and 45 kg",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "60 kg and 15 kg",
    explanation:
      "Let the weights be 4x and x. Then, 4x + x = 75 kg. Solving gives x = 15 kg. So, first type = 4 * 15 = 60 kg and second type = 15 kg.",

  {
    question:
      "A mixture of 80 liters of solution A contains 30% salt. A second solution contains 20% salt. If the two solutions are mixed, what will be the percentage of salt in the resulting mixture if the total volume becomes 120 liters?",
    options: ["25%", "20%", "15%", "30%"],
    correctAnswer: "25%",
    explanation:
      "Salt in A = 0.30 * 80 = 24 liters. Let the volume of B be 40 liters. Salt in B = 0.20 * 40 = 8 liters. Total salt = 24 + 8 = 32 liters. Percentage = (32/120) * 100 = 26.67%.",

    question:
      "A chemist has two solutions of 20% and 60% acid. He needs to prepare 100 liters of a solution that is 40% acid. How much of each solution should he use?",

    correctAnswer: "40 liters of 20% and 60 liters of 60%",
    explanation:
      "Let x be liters of 20% solution and y be liters of 60% solution. Then, x + y = 100 and 0.20x + 0.60y = 0.40 * 100. Solving gives x = 40 and y = 60.",
