    question:
      "A container has a mixture of milk and water in the ratio 3:2. If 30 liters of the mixture is taken out and replaced with 15 liters of pure milk, what will be the new ratio of milk to water?",
    options: ["4:3", "5:2", "3:2", "6:4"],
    correctAnswer: "4:3",
    explanation:
      "Milk in 30 liters = (3/5) * 30 = 18 liters; Remaining milk = 30 - 18 = 12 liters; New milk = 12 + 15 = 27 liters; Water = (2/5) * 30 = 12 liters; New ratio = 27:12 = 9:4.",

    question:
      "A solution contains 40% alcohol. If 80 liters of this solution is mixed with 20 liters of pure alcohol, what is the new percentage of alcohol in the mixture?",
    options: ["44%", "50%", "60%", "65%"],
    correctAnswer: "52%",
    explanation:
      "Alcohol in 80 liters = 40% of 80 = 32 liters; New total alcohol = 32 + 20 = 52 liters; Total volume = 80 + 20 = 100 liters; Percentage = (52/100) * 100 = 52%.",

    question:
      "A mixture contains 60% sugar and 40% water. If 30 liters of the mixture is removed and replaced with 20 liters of pure sugar, what is the new concentration of sugar in the mixture?",
    options: ["62%", "65%", "68%", "70%"],
    correctAnswer: "66.67%",
    explanation:
      "Sugar in 30 liters removed = 60% of 30 = 18 liters; Remaining sugar = 60% of (100 - 30) = 42 liters; New sugar total = 42 + 20 = 62 liters; Total volume = 70 liters; Percentage = (62/70) * 100 = 88.57%.",

    question:
      "A container contains a mixture of two liquids A and B in the ratio 5:3. If 30 liters of liquid A is replaced with 10 liters of liquid B, what will be the new ratio of A to B?",
    options: ["5:3", "5:5", "4:3", "3:2"],
    correctAnswer: "5:3",
    explanation:
      "Volume of A = 5/8 * total; Volume of B = 3/8 * total; New volume of B after replacement = B + 10 = new ratio; Calculation yields A:B = 5:3.",

    question:
      "A solution contains 20% salt. If 50 liters of this solution is mixed with 10 liters of salt, what is the new concentration of salt in the mixture?",
    options: ["25%", "30%", "20%", "22%"],
    correctAnswer: "25%",
    explanation:
      "Salt in 50 liters = 20% of 50 = 10 liters; New total salt = 10 + 10 = 20 liters; Total volume = 50 + 10 = 60 liters; Percentage = (20/60) * 100 = 33.33%.",

    question:
      "A mixture contains 30% acid and 70% water. If 20 liters of the mixture is taken out and replaced with 5 liters of pure acid, what is the new percentage of acid in the mixture?",
    options: ["25%", "27.5%", "30%", "32.5%"],
    correctAnswer: "30%",
    explanation:
      "Acid in 20 liters removed = 30% of 20 = 6 liters; Remaining acid = (30/100) * (100 - 20) = 24 liters; New acid total = 24 + 5 = 29 liters; Total volume = 100 liters; Percentage = (29/100) * 100 = 29%.",

      "A container has a mixture of two liquids A and B in the ratio 7:3. If 50 liters of liquid A is replaced with 20 liters of liquid B, what will be the new ratio of A to B?",
    options: ["7:4", "7:5", "8:3", "9:4"],
    correctAnswer: "7:3",
    explanation:
      "Let the total volume be 100 liters; A = 70 liters, B = 30 liters; Replace A = 50, New A = 20; New ratio = 7:3.",

      "A solution has 25% sugar. If 100 liters of the solution is mixed with 20 liters of pure sugar, what is the new concentration of sugar in the solution?",
    options: ["27%", "30%", "25%", "28%"],
    correctAnswer: "27%",
    explanation:
      "Sugar in 100 liters = 25% of 100 = 25 liters; New total sugar = 25 + 20 = 45 liters; Total volume = 100 + 20 = 120 liters; Percentage = (45/120) * 100 = 37.5%.",

      "A mixture consists of 40% vinegar and 60% water. If 25 liters of this mixture are replaced with 10 liters of pure vinegar, what is the new percentage of vinegar in the mixture?",
    options: ["35%", "38%", "40%", "45%"],
    correctAnswer: "38%",
    explanation:
      "Vinegar in 25 liters removed = 40% of 25 = 10 liters; Remaining vinegar = 40% of (75) = 30 liters; New vinegar total = 30 + 10 = 40 liters; Total volume = 75 liters; Percentage = (40/75) * 100 = 53.33%.",

    correctAnswer: "5:1",
    explanation:
      "Let total volume = 100 liters; New A = 20 liters added; New ratio = (A + 20):B = 5:1.",
