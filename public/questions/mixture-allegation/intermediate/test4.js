      "A mixture contains 40% sugar and 60% water. If 30 liters of this mixture is mixed with 20 liters of pure sugar, what is the final concentration of sugar in the new mixture?",
    options: ["50%", "55%", "60%", "65%"],
    correctAnswer: "50%",
    explanation:
      "Sugar in 30 liters = 40% of 30 = 12 liters; Total sugar = 12 + 20 = 32 liters; Total volume = 30 + 20 = 50 liters; Percentage = (32/50) * 100 = 64%.",

      "A container has a mixture of milk and water in the ratio 2:3. If 10 liters of the mixture is taken out and replaced with 4 liters of pure milk, what will be the new ratio of milk to water?",
    options: ["2:5", "3:4", "4:3", "1:2"],
    correctAnswer: "6:7",
    explanation:
      "Milk in 10 liters = (2/5) * 10 = 4 liters; Remaining milk = (2/5) * (50 - 10) = 16 liters; New milk = 16 + 4 = 20 liters; Total volume = 50 liters; New ratio = 20:30 = 2:3.",

    correctAnswer: "4:8",
    explanation:
      "Let the volumes of A and B be 40 and 50 liters respectively; New volume of B = 50 + 20 = 70 liters; New ratio = 40:70 = 4:7.",
