    question:
      "A mixture contains 20 liters of milk and 30 liters of water. If 10 liters of the mixture are replaced with 10 liters of pure milk, what will be the new ratio of milk to water?",
    options: ["4:3", "3:2", "2:3", "1:2"],
    correctAnswer: "26:14",
    explanation:
      "Initial milk = 20 liters; Initial water = 30 liters; Milk in 10 liters taken out = (20/(20+30)) * 10 = 4 liters; Remaining milk = 20 - 4 + 10 = 26 liters; Remaining water = 30 liters; New ratio = 26:30.",

    question:
      "A container has a mixture of 60% wine and 40% water. If 50 liters of this mixture are taken out and replaced with 50 liters of pure wine, what is the new percentage of wine?",
    options: ["70%", "75%", "80%", "85%"],
    correctAnswer: "72%",
    explanation:
      "Wine in 50 liters = 60% of 50 = 30 liters; Remaining wine = 60% of 200 = 120 liters; New wine total = 120 - 30 + 50 = 140 liters; Total volume = 200 liters; Percentage = (140/200) * 100 = 70%.",

    options: ["12%", "15%", "10%", "18%"],
    correctAnswer: "12.5%",
    explanation:
      "Salt in 200 liters = 15% of 200 = 30 liters; Total volume after dilution = 200 + 50 = 250 liters; New concentration = (30/250) * 100 = 12%.",

    correctAnswer: "37.5%",
    explanation:
      "Sugar in 40 liters = 25% of 40 = 10 liters; New sugar = 10 + 60 = 70 liters; Total volume = 40 + 60 = 100 liters; Percentage = (70/100) * 100 = 70%.",

    options: ["75%", "70%", "65%", "80%"],
    correctAnswer: "75%",
    explanation:
      "Milk in 30 liters taken out = 80% of 30 = 24 liters; Remaining milk = 80% of 70 = 56 liters; New total = 70 liters; Percentage = (56/70) * 100 = 80%.",

    question:
      "In a mixture, the ratio of A to B is 3:2. If 60 liters of mixture A is added to 40 liters of mixture B, what will be the new ratio of A to B?",
    options: ["6:5", "3:5", "4:5", "2:3"],
    correctAnswer: "4:3",
    explanation:
      "Initial quantity A = 3/5 * (60 + 40) = 36 liters; Initial quantity B = 2/5 * (60 + 40) = 24 liters; New A = 36 + 60 = 96; New B = 24 + 40 = 64; New ratio = 96:64 = 4:3.",

    options: ["50%", "55%", "60%", "65%"],
    correctAnswer: "50%",
    explanation:
      "Lemon juice in 10 liters removed = 45% of 10 = 4.5 liters; Remaining lemon juice = 45% of 90 = 40.5 liters; New lemon juice = 40.5 + 10 = 50.5 liters; Total volume = 100 liters; Percentage = (50.5/100) * 100 = 50%.",

    question:
      "A solution is made by mixing equal quantities of two liquids, one containing 40% oil and the other containing 60% oil. What is the percentage of oil in the new mixture?",
    options: ["45%", "50%", "55%", "60%"],
    correctAnswer: "50%",
    explanation:
      "Total oil from first liquid = 40% of V; Total oil from second liquid = 60% of V; Total volume = 2V; New percentage = (40 + 60)/(2) = 50%.",

    correctAnswer: "36%",
    explanation:
      "Alcohol in 20 liters removed = 30% of 20 = 6 liters; Remaining alcohol = 30% of 120 = 36 liters; New alcohol total = 36 - 6 + 20 = 50 liters; Total volume = 120 liters; Percentage = (50/120) * 100 = 41.67%.",
