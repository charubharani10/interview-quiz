    question:
      "A container holds a mixture of 30% salt and 70% water. If 25 liters of this mixture are replaced with 25 liters of pure water, what will be the new percentage of salt?",
    options: ["20%", "25%", "30%", "35%"],
    correctAnswer: "22.5%",
    explanation:
      "Salt in 25 liters = 30% of 25 = 7.5 liters; Remaining salt = 30% of 75 = 22.5 liters; Total volume = 100 liters; Percentage = (22.5/100) * 100 = 22.5%.",

      "A jar contains a mixture of 20% alcohol and 80% water. If 50 liters of the mixture is drawn and replaced with 50 liters of pure alcohol, what is the new concentration of alcohol in the jar?",
    options: ["40%", "50%", "60%", "70%"],
    correctAnswer: "40%",
    explanation:
      "Alcohol in 50 liters removed = 20% of 50 = 10 liters; Remaining alcohol = 20% of 150 = 30 liters; New alcohol = 30 + 50 = 80 liters; Total volume = 150 liters; Percentage = (80/150) * 100 = 53.33%.",

      "36 liters of A and 24 liters of B",
      "30 liters of A and 20 liters of B",
      "42 liters of A and 28 liters of B",
      "60 liters of A and 40 liters of B",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "36 liters of A and 24 liters of B",
    explanation:
      "Total mixture = 60 + 40 = 100 liters; A = (3/5) * 100 = 60 liters; B = (2/5) * 100 = 40 liters.",

    correctAnswer: "25%",
    explanation:
      "Sugar in 100 grams = 15 grams; New total sugar = 15 + 50 = 65 grams; Total solution = 100 + 50 = 150 grams; Percentage = (65/150) * 100 = 43.33%.",

    options: ["50%", "45%", "55%", "60%"],
    correctAnswer: "48.57%",
    explanation:
      "Milk in 20 liters = 40% of 20 = 8 liters; Remaining milk = 40% of 80 = 32 liters; New milk = 32 + 10 = 42 liters; Total volume = 80 liters; Percentage = (42/80) * 100 = 52.5%.",
