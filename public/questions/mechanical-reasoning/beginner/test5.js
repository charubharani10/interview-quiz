    question:
      "In a belt and pulley system, what happens if you increase the diameter of the driving pulley?",
    options: [
      "The driven pulley will rotate faster",
      "The driven pulley will rotate slower",
      "The belt will slip",
      "The system will lose efficiency",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "The driven pulley will rotate slower",
    explanation:
      "Increasing the diameter of the driving pulley causes the driven pulley to rotate slower because the speed ratio is inversely proportional to the diameters.",

    question:
      "What is the main purpose of a mechanical advantage in a simple machine?",
    options: [
      "To amplify force",
      "To increase speed",
      "To change direction",
      "To store energy",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "To amplify force",
    explanation:
      "Mechanical advantage amplifies the input force to lift or move heavier loads with less effort.",
  },
