      "question": "What is the output of: const [a, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; console.log(rest);",
      "options": [
        "[2, 3, 4]",
        "[1, 2, 3, 4]",
        "[1]",
        "TypeError"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "[2, 3, 4]",
      "explanation": "The rest operator (...) collects all remaining elements into an array. Here, a gets 1, and rest gets all remaining elements [2, 3, 4]."

      "question": "Which of the following is a correct way to use template literals?",
      "options": [
        "'Hello ${name}'",
        "\"Hello ${name}\"",
        "`Hello ${name}`",
        "Hello ${name}"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "`Hello ${name}`",
      "explanation": "Template literals use backticks (`) and ${expression} syntax for interpolation. Single or double quotes don't support interpolation."

      "question": "What is the output of: const obj = { a: 1 }; const { b = 2 } = obj; console.log(b);",
      "options": [
        "undefined",
        "1",
        "2",
        "ReferenceError"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "2",
      "explanation": "When destructuring, you can provide default values. Since obj doesn't have a 'b' property, the default value 2 is used."

    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between let and const?",
      "options": [
        "let is block-scoped, const is function-scoped",
        "let variables can be reassigned, const variables cannot",
        "let is hoisted, const is not",
        "let is for primitives, const is for objects"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "let variables can be reassigned, const variables cannot",
      "explanation": "Both let and const are block-scoped, but const variables cannot be reassigned after declaration. Note that const objects' properties can still be modified."

      "question": "What is the output of: async function test() { return 'hello'; } console.log(test());",

        "'hello'",
        "Promise { 'hello' }",
        "undefined",
        "Error"

      "correctAnswer": "Promise { 'hello' }",
      "explanation": "Async functions always return a promise. Even if we return a non-promise value, it gets wrapped in a promise automatically."
