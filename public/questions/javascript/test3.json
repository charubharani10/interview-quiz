      "question": "Which method is used to prevent both default event behavior and event bubbling?",
      "options": [
        "event.preventDefault()",
        "event.stopPropagation()",
        "event.stopImmediatePropagation()",
        "event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation()"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation()",
      "explanation": "preventDefault() stops the default behavior, while stopPropagation() prevents the event from bubbling up. You need both to stop both behaviors."

      "question": "What is event delegation?",
      "options": [
        "Directly binding events to dynamically created elements",
        "Attaching event listeners to parent elements to handle events on children",
        "Using multiple event listeners for the same event",
        "Removing event listeners automatically"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "Attaching event listeners to parent elements to handle events on children",
      "explanation": "Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element to handle events on its children, including future (dynamically added) children."

      "question": "Which method correctly creates a new element and adds it to the DOM?",
      "options": [
        "document.createElement('div').appendTo(document.body)",
        "document.body.createElement('div')",
        "document.createElement('div'); document.body.appendChild(div)",
        "const div = document.createElement('div'); document.body.appendChild(div)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "const div = document.createElement('div'); document.body.appendChild(div)",
      "explanation": "To add a new element to the DOM, first create it with createElement(), then append it to an existing element using appendChild()."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between innerHTML and textContent?",
      "options": [
        "They are identical in functionality",
        "innerHTML parses HTML, textContent treats everything as text",
        "textContent is faster but less secure",
        "innerHTML is always the better choice"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "innerHTML parses HTML, textContent treats everything as text",
      "explanation": "innerHTML parses content as HTML, which can execute scripts and create elements. textContent treats everything as plain text, which is safer and faster for text-only content."

      "question": "What is the correct way to remove an event listener?",
      "options": [
        "element.removeEventListener('click')",
        "element.removeEventListener('click', handler)",
        "element.removeEventListener(handler)",
        "element.removeEvent('click', handler)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "element.removeEventListener('click', handler)",
      "explanation": "To remove an event listener, you must provide both the event type and the same function reference that was used to add the listener."
