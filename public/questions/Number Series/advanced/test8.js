    options: ["20", "24", "30", "32"],
    correctAnswer: "32",
    explanation:
      "Each number is multiplied by 2: 2 x 2 = 4, 4 x 2 = 8, so the next is 16 x 2 = 32.",

    options: ["48", "120", "144", "720"],
    correctAnswer: "720",
    explanation:
      "These numbers are factorials: 0! = 1, 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24, so the next is 5! = 120.",

    correctAnswer: "243",
    explanation:
      "Each number is multiplied by 3: 3 x 3 = 9, 9 x 3 = 27, so the next is 81 x 3 = 243.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 2, 5, 10, 17, ...?",
    options: ["26", "27", "28", "29"],
    correctAnswer: "26",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 3, 5, 7, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 9, so 17 + 9 = 26.",

    options: ["30", "35", "36", "40"],
    correctAnswer: "36",
    explanation:
      "These are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, so the next is 6^2 = 36.",

    options: ["150", "200", "250", "300"],
    correctAnswer: "150",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 20, 30, 40, which increase by 10 each time. The next difference is 50, so 100 + 50 = 150.",

    correctAnswer: "16",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 1, 2, 3, 4, which increase by 1 each time. The next difference is 5, so 11 + 5 = 16.",

    correctAnswer: "160",
    explanation:
      "Each number is multiplied by 2: 5 x 2 = 10, 10 x 2 = 20, so the next is 80 x 2 = 160.",
