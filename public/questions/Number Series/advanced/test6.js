    options: ["100", "112", "120", "126"],
    correctAnswer: "112",
    explanation:
      "Each number is multiplied by 2: 7 x 2 = 14, 14 x 2 = 28, 28 x 2 = 56, so the next is 56 x 2 = 112.",

    options: ["24", "25", "26", "27"],
    correctAnswer: "26",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 3, 5, 7, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 9, so 17 + 9 = 26.",

    options: ["243", "256", "270", "300"],
    correctAnswer: "243",
    explanation:
      "Each number is multiplied by 3: 3 x 3 = 9, 9 x 3 = 27, 27 x 3 = 81, so the next is 81 x 3 = 243.",

    options: ["100", "125", "150", "175"],
    correctAnswer: "125",
    explanation:
      "These numbers are cubes: 1^3, 2^3, 3^3, 4^3, so the next is 5^3 = 125.",

    correctAnswer: "16",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 1, 2, 3, 4, which increase by 1 each time. The next difference is 5, so 11 + 5 = 16.",

    options: ["144", "192", "240", "288"],
    correctAnswer: "192",
    explanation:
      "Each number is multiplied by 2: 12 x 2 = 24, 24 x 2 = 48, 48 x 2 = 96, so the next is 96 x 2 = 192.",

    options: ["50", "55", "60", "70"],
    correctAnswer: "50",
    explanation:
      "These numbers increase by 10 each time. The next number is 40 + 10 = 50.",

    options: ["20", "21", "22", "25"],
    correctAnswer: "25",
    explanation:
      "These numbers are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, so the next is 5^2 = 25.",
