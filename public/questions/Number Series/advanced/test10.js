    options: ["20", "30", "32", "64"],
    correctAnswer: "32",
    explanation:
      "Each number is multiplied by 2: 1 x 2 = 2, 2 x 2 = 4, so the next is 16 x 2 = 32.",

    options: ["30", "36", "42", "50"],
    correctAnswer: "32",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 2, 4, 6, 8, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 10, so 22 + 10 = 32.",

    correctAnswer: "45",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 7, 9, 11, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 13, so 32 + 13 = 45.",

    options: ["1", "2", "3", "0"],
    correctAnswer: "0",
    explanation:
      "The differences are -1, -2, -3, which decrease by 1 each time. The next difference is -4, so 4 - 4 = 0.",

    correctAnswer: "26",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 1, 3, 5, 7, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 9, so 17 + 9 = 26.",

    options: ["38", "39", "40", "41"],
    correctAnswer: "38",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 3, 5, 7, 9, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 11, so 27 + 11 = 38.",

    correctAnswer: "60",
    explanation:
      "The difference is -10 each time: 100 - 10 = 90, so the next is 70 - 10 = 60.",

      "What is the next number in the series: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, ...?",
    options: ["42", "46", "49", "54"],
    correctAnswer: "49",
    explanation:
      "These are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, so the next is 7^2 = 49.",
