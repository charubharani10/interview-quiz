    options: ["30", "32", "34", "36"],
    correctAnswer: "34",
    explanation:
      "The differences are: 2, 4, 6, 8, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 10, so 22 + 12 = 34.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...?",
    options: ["21", "25", "28", "30"],
    correctAnswer: "21",
    explanation:
      "These are triangular numbers, where each term is the sum of the first n natural numbers. The next is 21.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 5, 10, 20, 40, ...?",
    options: ["60", "70", "80", "100"],
    correctAnswer: "80",
    explanation:
      "The series doubles each time: 5 x 2 = 10, 10 x 2 = 20, so the next number is 40 x 2 = 80.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, ...?",
    options: ["15", "16", "17", "18"],
    correctAnswer: "16",
    explanation:
      "The differences are: 1, 2, 3, 4, which increase by 1 each time. The next difference is 5, so 11 + 5 = 16.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the next number in the series: 2, 5, 10, 17, ...?",
    options: ["24", "25", "26", "27"],
    correctAnswer: "26",
    explanation:
      "The differences are: 3, 5, 7, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 9, so 17 + 9 = 26.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 10, 20, 30, 50, ...?",
    options: ["60", "70", "80", "90"],
    correctAnswer: "80",
    explanation:
      "The differences are: 10, 10, 20, which increase by 10. The next difference is 30, so 50 + 30 = 80.",

      "What is the next number in the series: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, ...?",
    options: ["42", "46", "49", "50"],
    correctAnswer: "49",
    explanation:
      "These are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, so the next is 7^2 = 49.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 8, 7, 10, 9, 12, ...?",
    options: ["11", "12", "13", "14"],
    correctAnswer: "11",
    explanation:
      "The pattern alternates: subtract 1, add 3, subtract 1, add 3, so the next is 10 - 1 = 9.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, ...?",
    options: ["15", "17", "18", "19"],
    correctAnswer: "17",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, which follow the Fibonacci sequence, so the next difference is 5, so 12 + 5 = 17.",
  },

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 4, 8, 14, 22, 34, ...?",
    options: ["46", "50", "58", "64"],
    correctAnswer: "46",
    explanation:
      "The differences are: 4, 6, 8, 12, which are increasing, so the next difference is 12, thus 34 + 12 = 46.",
