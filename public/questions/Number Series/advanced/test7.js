    options: ["13", "15", "17", "19"],
    correctAnswer: "13",
    explanation:
      "These are prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, so the next prime number is 13.",

    options: ["10", "11", "12", "13"],
    correctAnswer: "13",
    explanation:
      "This is the Fibonacci series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 5 + 8 = 13.",

    options: ["30", "31", "32", "33"],
    correctAnswer: "30",
    explanation:
      "These numbers decrease by 5 each time: 50 - 5 = 45, 45 - 5 = 40, so the next is 35 - 5 = 30.",

    correctAnswer: "21",
    explanation:
      "These are triangular numbers: 1 (1), 3 (1+2), 6 (1+2+3), 10 (1+2+3+4), 15 (1+2+3+4+5), so the next is 21 (1+2+3+4+5+6).",

    options: ["36", "48", "60", "72"],
    correctAnswer: "48",
    explanation:
      "Each number is multiplied by 2: 3 x 2 = 6, 6 x 2 = 12, 12 x 2 = 24, so the next is 24 x 2 = 48.",

    options: ["50", "60", "65", "70"],
    correctAnswer: "65",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 5, 10, 15, which increase by 5 each time. The next difference is 25, so 40 + 25 = 65.",

    correctAnswer: "32",
    explanation:
      "Each number is multiplied by 2: 1 x 2 = 2, 2 x 2 = 4, so the next is 16 x 2 = 32.",

    correctAnswer: "26",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 3, 4, 5, 6, which increase by 1 each time. The next difference is 7, so 19 + 7 = 26.",

    options: ["216", "225", "236", "250"],
    correctAnswer: "216",
    explanation:
      "These numbers are cubes: 2^3, 3^3, 4^3, 5^3, so the next is 6^3 = 216.",
