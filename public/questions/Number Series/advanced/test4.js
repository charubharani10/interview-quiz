    options: ["22", "23", "24", "25"],
    correctAnswer: "23",
    explanation:
      "The differences between consecutive terms are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The next difference is 6, so 17 + 6 = 23.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 11, 14, 18, 23, 29, ...?",
    options: ["36", "37", "38", "39"],
    correctAnswer: "36",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 3, 4, 5, 6, which increase by 1 each time. The next difference is 7, so 29 + 7 = 36.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, ...?",
    options: ["720", "600", "480", "360"],
    correctAnswer: "720",
    explanation:
      "These numbers are factorials: 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24, 5! = 120, so the next is 6! = 720.",

    options: ["38", "40", "41", "43"],
    correctAnswer: "38",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 2, 4, 6, 9. The next difference is 12, so 26 + 12 = 38.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 3, 9, 27, 81, ...?",
    options: ["162", "243", "324", "405"],
    correctAnswer: "243",
    explanation:
      "Each number is multiplied by 3: 3 x 3 = 9, 9 x 3 = 27, 27 x 3 = 81, so the next is 81 x 3 = 243.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...?",
    options: ["10", "11", "12", "13"],
    correctAnswer: "13",
    explanation:
      "These are Fibonacci numbers, where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones: 5 + 8 = 13.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 100, 90, 80, 70, ...?",
    options: ["60", "50", "40", "30"],
    correctAnswer: "60",
    explanation:
      "The series decreases by 10 each time: 100 - 10 = 90, 90 - 10 = 80, so the next is 70 - 10 = 60.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 3, 6, 11, 18, ...?",
    options: ["27", "28", "29", "30"],
    correctAnswer: "27",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 3, 5, 7, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 9, so 18 + 9 = 27.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...?",
    options: ["30", "36", "40", "42"],
    correctAnswer: "36",
    explanation:
      "These are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, so the next is 6^2 = 36.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, ...?",
    options: ["37", "40", "41", "42"],
    correctAnswer: "37",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 3, 5, 7, 9, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 11, so 26 + 11 = 37.",
