    question: "What is the next number in the series: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ...?",
    options: ["42", "56", "72", "90"],
    correctAnswer: "42",
    explanation:
      "The differences between the numbers are 4, 6, 8, 10, which increase by 2. The next difference is 12, so 30 + 12 = 42.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...?",
    options: ["30", "36", "40", "45"],
    correctAnswer: "36",
    explanation:
      "These are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2. The next number is 6^2 = 36.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 3, 7, 13, 21, ...?",
    options: ["30", "31", "32", "33"],
    correctAnswer: "31",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 4, 6, 8, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 10, so 21 + 10 = 31.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 10, 30, 60, 100, ...?",
    options: ["150", "200", "240", "300"],
    correctAnswer: "150",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 20, 30, 40, which increase by 10 each time. The next difference is 50, so 100 + 50 = 150.",
  },

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 5, 11, 23, 47, ...?",
    options: ["95", "96", "97", "98"],
    correctAnswer: "95",
    explanation:
      "The pattern is each number is one less than double the previous: (5 x 2) - 1 = 11, (11 x 2) - 1 = 23, (23 x 2) - 1 = 47, so (47 x 2) - 1 = 95.",
  },

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...?",
    options: ["21", "22", "23", "24"],
    correctAnswer: "21",
    explanation:
      "These are triangular numbers. The differences are 2, 3, 4, 5. The next difference is 6, so 15 + 6 = 21.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 8, 16, 32, 64, ...?",
    options: ["128", "130", "132", "134"],
    correctAnswer: "128",
    explanation:
      "The series doubles each time: 8 x 2 = 16, 16 x 2 = 32, 32 x 2 = 64, so the next number is 64 x 2 = 128.",
  },

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...?",
    options: ["13", "14", "15", "16"],
    correctAnswer: "13",
    explanation:
      "These are consecutive prime numbers. The next prime number after 11 is 13.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 50, 45, 40, 35, ...?",
    options: ["30", "25", "20", "15"],
    correctAnswer: "30",
    explanation:
      "The series decreases by 5 each time: 50 - 5 = 45, 45 - 5 = 40, so the next number is 35 - 5 = 30.",
  },

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...?",
    options: ["32", "36", "40", "44"],
    correctAnswer: "32",
    explanation:
      "The series doubles each time: 1 x 2 = 2, 2 x 2 = 4, so the next number is 16 x 2 = 32.",
