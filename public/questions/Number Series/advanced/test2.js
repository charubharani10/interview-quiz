    options: ["48", "120", "720", "5040"],
    correctAnswer: "120",
    explanation:
      "These numbers are the factorials: 0! = 1, 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24, so 5! = 120.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 2, 3, 7, 8, 14, ...?",
    options: ["15", "18", "21", "28"],
    correctAnswer: "21",
    explanation:
      "The pattern alternates: add 1, add 4, add 1, add 6, so the next is 14 + 7 = 21.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 3, 6, 11, 18, ...?",
    options: ["25", "26", "27", "28"],
    correctAnswer: "27",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 3, 5, 7, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 9, so 18 + 9 = 27.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...?",
    options: ["30", "36", "40", "45"],
    correctAnswer: "36",
    explanation:
      "These are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, so the next is 6^2 = 36.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...?",
    options: ["24", "30", "32", "48"],
    correctAnswer: "32",
    explanation:
      "The series doubles each time: 1 x 2 = 2, 2 x 2 = 4, so the next number is 16 x 2 = 32.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 100, 90, 80, 70, ...?",
    options: ["60", "50", "40", "30"],
    correctAnswer: "60",
    explanation:
      "The series decreases by 10 each time: 100 - 10 = 90, 90 - 10 = 80, so the next number is 70 - 10 = 60.",
  },

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 3, 5, 9, 17, ...?",
    options: ["32", "33", "34", "35"],
    correctAnswer: "33",
    explanation:
      "The pattern is each number is one less than double the previous: (3 x 2) - 3 = 5, (5 x 2) - 5 = 9, so (17 x 2) - 1 = 33.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 7, 14, 28, 56, ...?",
    options: ["112", "120", "128", "140"],
    correctAnswer: "112",
    explanation:
      "The series doubles each time: 7 x 2 = 14, 14 x 2 = 28, so the next number is 56 x 2 = 112.",

    options: ["6", "7", "8", "9"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation:
      "This is the Fibonacci series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 5 + 3 = 8.",
