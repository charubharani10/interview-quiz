    question: "What is the next number in the series: 5, 10, 20, 40, ...?",
    options: ["60", "70", "80", "100"],
    correctAnswer: "80",
    explanation:
      "The series doubles each time: 5 x 2 = 10, 10 x 2 = 20, 20 x 2 = 40, so the next number is 40 x 2 = 80.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...?",
    options: ["7", "8", "9", "10"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation:
      "This is the Fibonacci series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 3 + 5 = 8.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 100, 90, 80, 70, ...?",
    options: ["60", "50", "40", "30"],
    correctAnswer: "60",
    explanation:
      "The series decreases by 10 each time: 100 - 10 = 90, 90 - 10 = 80, 80 - 10 = 70, so the next number is 70 - 10 = 60.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the next number in the series: 4, 8, 12, 16, ...?",
    options: ["20", "22", "24", "28"],
    correctAnswer: "20",
    explanation:
      "The series adds 4, then 4, then 8. The pattern continues with an increase of 4, so 16 + 4 = 20.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 21, 34, 55, 89, ...?",
    options: ["120", "144", "144", "144"],
    correctAnswer: "144",
    explanation:
      "This is the Fibonacci series: 21 + 34 = 55, 34 + 55 = 89, so 55 + 89 = 144.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 2, 3, 5, 7, ...?",
    options: ["9", "10", "11", "12"],
    correctAnswer: "11",
    explanation:
      "These are consecutive prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7. The next prime number is 11.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 10, 15, 25, 40, ...?",
    options: ["55", "60", "70", "80"],
    correctAnswer: "55",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 5, 10, and 15, which increase by 5 each time. The next difference is 20, making the next number 40 + 15 = 55.",
  },

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 2, 6, 12, 20, ...?",
    options: ["30", "32", "34", "36"],
    correctAnswer: "30",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 4, 6, and 8, which increase by 2 each time. The next difference is 10, so 20 + 10 = 30.",
  },

    options: ["15", "16", "17", "18"],
    correctAnswer: "16",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 1, 2, 3, 4, which increase by 1 each time. The next difference is 5, so 11 + 5 = 16.",

    correctAnswer: "26",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 3, 5, 7, which increase by 2. The next difference is 9, so 17 + 9 = 26.",
