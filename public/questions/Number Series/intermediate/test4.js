    question: "What is the next number in the series: 2, 5, 10, 17, ...?",
    options: ["24", "25", "26", "27"],
    correctAnswer: "26",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 3, 5, 7, which increase by 2. The next difference is 9, making the next number 17 + 9 = 26.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 9, 18, 36, 72, ...?",
    options: ["144", "150", "162", "180"],
    correctAnswer: "144",
    explanation:
      "The series doubles each time: 9 x 2 = 18, 18 x 2 = 36, 36 x 2 = 72, so the next number is 72 x 2 = 144.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 4, 9, 16, ...?",
    options: ["20", "21", "22", "25"],
    correctAnswer: "25",
    explanation:
      "These are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2. The next number is 5^2 = 25.",

    options: ["30", "48", "60", "72"],
    correctAnswer: "48",
    explanation:
      "The series doubles and adds 6: (3 x 2) = 6, (6 x 2) = 12, (12 x 2) = 24, so the next number is 24 x 2 = 48.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 3, 6, 10, ...?",
    options: ["12", "13", "14", "15"],
    correctAnswer: "15",
    explanation:
      "These are triangular numbers: 1, 3 (1+2), 6 (3+3), 10 (6+4). The next is 10 + 5 = 15.",

    options: ["75", "80", "85", "90"],
    correctAnswer: "75",
    explanation:
      "The series adds 15 each time: 15 + 15 = 30, 30 + 15 = 45, 45 + 15 = 60, so the next number is 60 + 15 = 75.",

    options: ["38", "40", "44", "48"],
    correctAnswer: "40",
    explanation:
      "The series adds 8 each time: 8 + 8 = 16, 16 + 8 = 24, 24 + 8 = 32, so the next number is 32 + 8 = 40.",

    question: "What is the next number in the series: 1, 2, 4, 8, ...?",
    options: ["10", "12", "14", "16"],
    correctAnswer: "16",
    explanation:
      "The series doubles each time: 1 x 2 = 2, 2 x 2 = 4, 4 x 2 = 8, so the next number is 8 x 2 = 16.",

    options: ["70", "80", "90", "100"],
    correctAnswer: "70",
    explanation:
      "The differences are 10, 10, 20. The next difference increases by 10, so 50 + 20 = 70.",
