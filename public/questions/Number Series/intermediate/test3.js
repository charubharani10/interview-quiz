    options: ["60", "70", "80", "90"],
    correctAnswer: "80",
    explanation:
      "The series adds consecutive numbers: 10 + 10 = 20, 20 + 10 = 30, 30 + 20 = 50. The next addition is 30, making it 50 + 30 = 80.",

    explanation:
      "Each number is multiplied by 2: 1 x 2 = 2, 2 x 2 = 4, 4 x 2 = 8, 8 x 2 = 16, so the next number is 16 x 2 = 32.",

    explanation:
      "The series decreases by 20 each time: 100 - 20 = 80, 80 - 20 = 60, 60 - 20 = 40, so the next number is 40 - 20 = 20.",

    options: ["60", "62.5", "63", "65"],
    correctAnswer: "62.5",
    explanation:
      "Each number is divided by 2: 1000 / 2 = 500, 500 / 2 = 250, 250 / 2 = 125, so the next number is 125 / 2 = 62.5.",

    explanation:
      "The series adds 7 each time: 7 + 7 = 14, 14 + 7 = 21, 21 + 7 = 28, so the next number is 28 + 7 = 35.",
