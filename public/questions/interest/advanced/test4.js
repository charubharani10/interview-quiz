      "If a sum of $20,000 is invested at a simple interest rate of 6% per annum for 8 years, how much interest is earned?",
    options: ["$9,600", "$10,800", "$11,200", "$12,000"],
    correctAnswer: "$9,600",
    explanation:
      "Interest = Principal × Rate × Time = $20,000 × 0.06 × 8 = $9,600.",

    question:
      "A principal amount of $15,000 is invested for 4 years at a simple interest rate. If the total amount at the end of the investment period is $18,000, what is the rate of interest?",
    options: ["5%", "7.5%", "10%", "12%"],
    correctAnswer: "5%",
    explanation:
      "Total Amount = Principal + Interest; $18,000 = $15,000 + Interest; Interest = $18,000 - $15,000 = $3,000; Rate = (Interest / (Principal × Time)) × 100 = ($3,000 / ($15,000 × 4)) × 100 = 5%.",

      "If $1,200 is invested at a simple interest rate of 9% per annum and earns $432 in interest, how long was the money invested?",
    options: ["3 years", "4 years", "5 years", "6 years"],
    correctAnswer: "4 years",
    explanation:
      "Interest = Principal × Rate × Time; $432 = $1,200 × 0.09 × Time; Time = $432 / ($1,200 × 0.09) = 4 years.",

      "A sum of money doubles itself in 10 years at a certain simple interest rate. What is the interest rate?",
    options: ["5%", "10%", "15%", "20%"],
    correctAnswer: "10%",
    explanation:
      "If the amount doubles, then Interest = Principal; Interest = Principal × Rate × Time; 1P = P × Rate × 10; Rate = 1/10 = 0.10 or 10%.",

    correctAnswer: "$37,500",
    explanation:
      "Total Amount = Principal + Interest = $25,000 + ($25,000 × 0.05 × 12) = $25,000 + $15,000 = $40,000.",
