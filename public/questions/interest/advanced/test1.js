    correctAnswer: "$9,000",
    explanation:
      "Interest = Principal × Rate × Time = $5,000 × 0.10 × 8 = $4,000; Total Amount = $5,000 + $4,000 = $9,000.",

    correctAnswer: "$6,000",
    explanation:
      "Let Principal = P. Total Amount = P + (P × Rate × Time) = P + (P × 0.12 × 3); $8,000 = P(1 + 0.36); P = $8,000 / 1.36 = $5,882.35 (approximately).",

    explanation:
