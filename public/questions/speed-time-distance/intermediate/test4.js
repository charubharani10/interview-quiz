      "A bus travels at a speed of 80 km/h. How long will it take to travel 320 km?",
    options: ["3 hours", "4 hours", "5 hours", "6 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "4 hours",
    explanation: "Time = Distance / Speed = 320 km / 80 km/h = 4 hours.",

    question:
      "A car leaves a city and travels 60 km north in 1 hour. Then, it turns and travels 80 km east in 1.5 hours. What is the total distance traveled by the car?",
    options: ["130 km", "140 km", "150 km", "160 km"],
    correctAnswer: "140 km",
    explanation: "Total distance = 60 km + 80 km = 140 km.",

      "A person travels at a speed of 5 m/s. How far will he travel in 10 minutes?",
    options: ["300 m", "600 m", "1000 m", "1500 m"],
    correctAnswer: "3000 m",
    explanation:
      "Time in seconds = 10 × 60 = 600 seconds. Distance = Speed × Time = 5 m/s × 600 s = 3000 m.",

    question:
      "If a cyclist can travel 24 km in 1 hour, how long will it take to travel 96 km?",
    options: ["3 hours", "4 hours", "5 hours", "6 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "4 hours",
    explanation: "Time = Distance / Speed = 96 km / 24 km/h = 4 hours.",

    question:
      "A train travels at a speed of 90 km/h. If it travels for 2 hours, how far does it go?",
    options: ["150 km", "180 km", "200 km", "210 km"],
    correctAnswer: "180 km",
    explanation: "Distance = Speed × Time = 90 km/h × 2 hours = 180 km.",

    question:
      "A car and a bike start from the same point. The car travels at 100 km/h, and the bike travels at 40 km/h. How far apart will they be after 1 hour?",
    options: ["40 km", "60 km", "70 km", "80 km"],
    correctAnswer: "60 km",
    explanation:
      "Distance covered by car = 100 km; Distance covered by bike = 40 km. Distance apart = 100 km - 40 km = 60 km.",

    options: ["80 km/h", "82 km/h", "84 km/h", "86 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "81.82 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Average speed = (2 × Speed1 × Speed2) / (Speed1 + Speed2) = (2 × 75 × 90) / (75 + 90) = 13500 / 165 = 81.82 km/h.",

    correctAnswer: "12 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Time in hours = 50/60 = 0.833 hours. Average speed = Distance / Time = 10 km / 0.833 hours = 12 km/h.",

    options: ["15 km/h", "20 km/h", "25 km/h", "30 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "25 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Speed upstream = Distance / Time = 30 km / 2 hours = 15 km/h; Speed downstream = 30 km / 1 hour = 30 km/h. Speed of boat in still water = (15 + 30) / 2 = 22.5 km/h.",
