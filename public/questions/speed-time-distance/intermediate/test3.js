    question:
      "A cyclist travels 90 km in 4 hours. If he increases his speed by 5 km/h, how long will it take him to travel 180 km?",
    options: ["5 hours", "6 hours", "7 hours", "8 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "6 hours",
    explanation:
      "Original speed = 90 km / 4 hours = 22.5 km/h. New speed = 22.5 km/h + 5 km/h = 27.5 km/h. Time to travel 180 km = 180 km / 27.5 km/h = 6.55 hours, approximately 6 hours.",

    question:
      "A train travels from City A to City B at 75 km/h and returns at 100 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire journey?",
    options: ["85 km/h", "87.5 km/h", "90 km/h", "95 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "85 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Average speed = (2 × Speed1 × Speed2) / (Speed1 + Speed2) = (2 × 75 × 100) / (75 + 100) = 15000 / 175 = 85 km/h.",
  },

    question:
      "A boat takes 3 hours to travel downstream and 5 hours to return upstream. If the distance covered each way is the same, what is the ratio of the speed of the boat in still water to the speed of the current?",
    options: ["2:1", "3:1", "4:1", "5:1"],
    correctAnswer: "3:1",
    explanation:
      "Let the speed of the boat in still water be b km/h and the speed of the current be c km/h. Distance = speed × time. For downstream: Distance = (b + c) × 3. For upstream: Distance = (b - c) × 5. Setting these equal gives: (b + c) × 3 = (b - c) × 5. Solving leads to the ratio b:c = 3:1.",

    question:
      "A person covers a distance of 240 km at a speed of 80 km/h. How long does the journey take?",
    options: ["2.5 hours", "3 hours", "3.5 hours", "4 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "3 hours",
    explanation: "Time = Distance / Speed = 240 km / 80 km/h = 3 hours.",

    question:
      "A car travels 150 km in 2 hours and 30 minutes. What is the speed of the car in km/h?",
    options: ["55 km/h", "60 km/h", "65 km/h", "70 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "60 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Time in hours = 2.5 hours. Speed = Distance / Time = 150 km / 2.5 hours = 60 km/h.",

  {
    question:
      "If two trains are moving towards each other at speeds of 60 km/h and 90 km/h, how long will they take to meet if they are initially 300 km apart?",
    options: ["1 hour", "1.5 hours", "2 hours", "2.5 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "1 hour",
    explanation:
      "Relative speed = 60 km/h + 90 km/h = 150 km/h. Time = Distance / Speed = 300 km / 150 km/h = 2 hours.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "A runner completes a 10 km race in 45 minutes. What is his average speed in km/h?",
    options: ["10 km/h", "12 km/h", "13 km/h", "14 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "13.33 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Time in hours = 45/60 = 0.75 hours. Average speed = Distance / Time = 10 km / 0.75 hours = 13.33 km/h.",

      "A ship travels 240 km in 6 hours. How fast does it travel in km/h?",
    options: ["36 km/h", "40 km/h", "42 km/h", "44 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "40 km/h",
    explanation: "Speed = Distance / Time = 240 km / 6 hours = 40 km/h.",

    question:
      "If a vehicle travels at 60 km/h, how long will it take to cover 90 km?",
    options: ["1 hour", "1.5 hours", "2 hours", "2.5 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "1.5 hours",
    explanation: "Time = Distance / Speed = 90 km / 60 km/h = 1.5 hours.",

  {
    question:
      "A person walks 5 km at 4 km/h and then runs 2 km at 10 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire journey?",
    options: ["5 km/h", "6 km/h", "7 km/h", "8 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "6.29 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Total distance = 5 km + 2 km = 7 km. Time for walking = 5 km / 4 km/h = 1.25 hours. Time for running = 2 km / 10 km/h = 0.2 hours. Total time = 1.25 + 0.2 = 1.45 hours. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 7 km / 1.45 hours = 4.83 km/h, approximately 6.29 km/h.",
