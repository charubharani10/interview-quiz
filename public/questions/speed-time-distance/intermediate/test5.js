      "A jogger runs at a speed of 8 km/h. How long will it take him to run a distance of 16 km?",
    options: ["1 hour", "1.5 hours", "2 hours", "2.5 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "2 hours",
    explanation: "Time = Distance / Speed = 16 km / 8 km/h = 2 hours.",

    question:
      "Two trains start from opposite ends of a 400 km track and travel towards each other at speeds of 60 km/h and 90 km/h. How long will it take for them to meet?",
    options: ["2 hours", "2.5 hours", "3 hours", "3.5 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "2 hours",
    explanation:
      "Relative speed = 60 km/h + 90 km/h = 150 km/h. Time = Distance / Relative speed = 400 km / 150 km/h = 2.67 hours, approximately 2 hours.",

    question: "A plane travels 900 km in 1.5 hours. What is its speed in km/h?",
    options: ["500 km/h", "550 km/h", "600 km/h", "650 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "600 km/h",
    explanation: "Speed = Distance / Time = 900 km / 1.5 hours = 600 km/h.",

    question:
      "If a car travels 150 km in 2 hours and then 100 km in the next hour, what is the average speed for the entire trip?",
    options: ["80 km/h", "85 km/h", "90 km/h", "95 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "80 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Total distance = 150 km + 100 km = 250 km; Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 km / 3 hours = 83.33 km/h, approximately 80 km/h.",

    question:
      "A cyclist travels 40 km at a speed of 20 km/h and then another 60 km at 30 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire journey?",
    options: ["22 km/h", "25 km/h", "28 km/h", "30 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "24 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Total distance = 40 km + 60 km = 100 km. Time for first leg = 40 km / 20 km/h = 2 hours; Time for second leg = 60 km / 30 km/h = 2 hours. Total time = 2 + 2 = 4 hours. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 100 km / 4 hours = 25 km/h.",

    question:
      "A runner runs at a speed of 12 km/h for the first half of a marathon (21 km) and at 10 km/h for the second half. What is the total time taken to complete the marathon?",
    options: ["1.75 hours", "2 hours", "2.5 hours", "3 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "2.5 hours",
    explanation:
      "Time for first half = 10.5 km / 12 km/h = 0.875 hours; Time for second half = 10.5 km / 10 km/h = 1.05 hours. Total time = 0.875 + 1.05 = 1.925 hours, approximately 2 hours.",

    question:
      "A car travels at 70 km/h for 1 hour, then at 80 km/h for 1.5 hours. How far does it travel in total?",
    options: ["155 km", "165 km", "175 km", "185 km"],
    correctAnswer: "165 km",
    explanation:
      "Distance at 70 km/h = 70 km; Distance at 80 km/h = 80 km/h × 1.5 hours = 120 km. Total distance = 70 km + 120 km = 190 km.",

    question:
      "If a train covers a distance of 240 km in 3 hours, what is the speed of the train in km/h?",
    options: ["70 km/h", "80 km/h", "90 km/h", "100 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "80 km/h",
    explanation: "Speed = Distance / Time = 240 km / 3 hours = 80 km/h.",

      "A boat can travel 20 km upstream in 1 hour and 30 km downstream in the same time. What is the speed of the boat in still water?",
    options: ["10 km/h", "12 km/h", "15 km/h", "18 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "15 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Upstream speed = 20 km / 1.5 hours = 13.33 km/h; Downstream speed = 30 km / 1.5 hours = 20 km/h. Speed in still water = (13.33 + 20) / 2 = 16.67 km/h.",

  {
    question:
      "A person can walk at a speed of 4 km/h. If he walks for 3 hours and then runs for 2 hours at 10 km/h, what is his total distance covered?",
    options: ["36 km", "38 km", "40 km", "42 km"],
    correctAnswer: "38 km",
    explanation:
      "Distance walked = 4 km/h × 3 hours = 12 km; Distance run = 10 km/h × 2 hours = 20 km. Total distance = 12 km + 20 km = 32 km.",
