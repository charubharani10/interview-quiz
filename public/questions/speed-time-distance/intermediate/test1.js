    question:
      "Two trains are moving in opposite directions at speeds of 60 km/h and 90 km/h, respectively. If they take 10 seconds to cross each other, what is the length of each train assuming they are of equal length?",
    options: ["208 meters", "250 meters", "275 meters", "300 meters"],
    correctAnswer: "208 meters",
    explanation:
      "Relative speed = 60 km/h + 90 km/h = 150 km/h = 150 * (1000 / 3600) m/s = 41.67 m/s. Distance = Speed × Time = 41.67 m/s × 10 s = 416.7 meters. Since the trains are of equal length, each train is 208.35 meters long.",

      "A man walks at 5 km/h and runs at 10 km/h. He covers a distance of 20 km, taking 3 hours in total. How much distance did he walk?",
    options: ["10 km", "12 km", "14 km", "16 km"],
    correctAnswer: "10 km",
    explanation:
      "Let the walking time be t hours. Then, the running time is (3 - t) hours. Equation: 5t + 10(3 - t) = 20. Solving, t = 2 hours. Distance walked = 5 × 2 = 10 km.",

    options: ["65 km/h", "67 km/h", "70 km/h", "72 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "67 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Average speed = (2 × Speed1 × Speed2) / (Speed1 + Speed2) = (2 × 80 × 60) / (80 + 60) = 9600 / 140 = 68.57 km/h. Therefore, the car's average speed is approximately 67 km/h.",

    correctAnswer: "60 km/h",
    explanation:
      "For the first half, time taken = Distance / Speed = 75 km / 40 km/h = 1.875 hours. Remaining time = 3 - 1.875 = 1.125 hours. Speed for the second half = Distance / Time = 75 km / 1.125 hours = 66.67 km/h, approximately 60 km/h.",
