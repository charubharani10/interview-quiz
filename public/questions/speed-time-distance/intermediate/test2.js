    question:
      "A vehicle covers 150 km in 3 hours and then 120 km in 2 hours. What is the average speed of the vehicle for the entire journey?",
    options: ["60 km/h", "70 km/h", "75 km/h", "80 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "75 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Total distance = 150 km + 120 km = 270 km. Total time = 3 hours + 2 hours = 5 hours. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 270 km / 5 hours = 75 km/h.",
  },

    question:
      "A bus travels at a speed of 72 km/h. How far will it travel in 3 hours and 15 minutes?",
    options: ["225 km", "230 km", "235 km", "240 km"],
    correctAnswer: "234 km",
    explanation:
      "Time in hours = 3 + 15/60 = 3.25 hours. Distance = Speed × Time = 72 km/h × 3.25 hours = 234 km.",

    question:
      "A man walks 4 km in 50 minutes. If he continues at the same speed, how long will it take him to walk 10 km?",
    options: ["1 hour", "1.5 hours", "2 hours", "2.5 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "1.5 hours",
    explanation:
      "Speed = Distance / Time = 4 km / (50/60) hours = 4.8 km/h. Time to walk 10 km = 10 km / 4.8 km/h = 2.08 hours, approximately 1.5 hours.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If a train travels at a speed of 80 km/h, how long will it take to cover a distance of 200 km?",
    options: ["2 hours", "2.5 hours", "3 hours", "3.5 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "2.5 hours",
    explanation: "Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 80 km/h = 2.5 hours.",

    question:
      "A motorbike travels 180 km in 2 hours and 30 minutes. What is its average speed?",
    options: ["60 km/h", "65 km/h", "70 km/h", "75 km/h"],
    correctAnswer: "72 km/h",
    explanation:
      "Time in hours = 2.5 hours. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 180 km / 2.5 hours = 72 km/h.",

    question:
      "Two cars start from the same point and drive in opposite directions. Car A travels at 90 km/h, and Car B travels at 60 km/h. How far apart will they be after 2 hours?",
    options: ["300 km", "330 km", "360 km", "420 km"],
    correctAnswer: "300 km",
    explanation:
      "Distance traveled by Car A = 90 km/h × 2 hours = 180 km. Distance traveled by Car B = 60 km/h × 2 hours = 120 km. Total distance apart = 180 km + 120 km = 300 km.",

    question:
      "A person jogs at a speed of 8 km/h. How far will he cover in 45 minutes?",
    options: ["6 km", "5 km", "4 km", "3 km"],
    correctAnswer: "6 km",
    explanation:
      "Time in hours = 45/60 = 0.75 hours. Distance = Speed × Time = 8 km/h × 0.75 hours = 6 km.",

    question:
      "A plane flies from City X to City Y at a speed of 750 km/h. If the distance between the two cities is 1500 km, how long will the flight take?",
    options: ["1 hour", "2 hours", "2.5 hours", "3 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "2 hours",
    explanation: "Time = Distance / Speed = 1500 km / 750 km/h = 2 hours.",

      "A car travels 60 km in 40 minutes. What will be the time taken to travel 240 km at the same speed?",
    options: ["2 hours", "2.5 hours", "3 hours", "3.5 hours"],
    correctAnswer: "3 hours",
    explanation:
      "Speed = Distance / Time = 60 km / (40/60) hours = 90 km/h. Time to cover 240 km = 240 km / 90 km/h = 2.67 hours, approximately 3 hours.",
