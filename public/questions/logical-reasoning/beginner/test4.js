    options: ["14", "15", "16", "17"],
    correctAnswer: "16",
    explanation:
      "The series increases by 3 each time: 4 + 3 = 7, 7 + 3 = 10, 10 + 3 = 13. Thus, the next number is 13 + 3 = 16.",

    options: ["69218", "69209", "69118", "69229"],
    correctAnswer: "69218",
    explanation:
      "The code converts letters to their alphabetical positions (B=2, I=9, R=18, D=4), so for FISH, F=6, I=9, S=19, H=8, resulting in 69218.",

    options: ["7", "8", "9", "10"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation:
      "The pattern seems to subtract 1 from the normal sum: 7 + 3 = 10 (10 - 1 = 9), 5 + 4 = 9 (9 - 1 = 8). Thus, 6 + 2 = 8.",

    options: ["36", "48", "60", "72"],
    correctAnswer: "48",
    explanation:
      "The series multiplies by 2 each time: 3 × 2 = 6, 6 × 2 = 12, 12 × 2 = 24. Thus, the next number is 24 × 2 = 48.",

    options: ["41827", "41826", "51926", "41726"],
    correctAnswer: "41827",
    explanation:
      "The code converts letters to their alphabetical positions (C=3, A=1, T=20), so for DOG, D=4, O=15, G=7, resulting in 41827.",

    question:
      "Which number should replace the question mark? 5, 10, 15, 20, ____?",
    options: ["25", "30", "35", "40"],
    correctAnswer: "25",
    explanation:
      "The series increases by 5 each time: 5 + 5 = 10, 10 + 5 = 15, 15 + 5 = 20. Thus, the next number is 20 + 5 = 25.",

    correctAnswer: "75915",
    explanation:
      "The code converts letters to their alphabetical positions (T=20, R=18, E=5). For ROSE, R=18, O=15, S=19, E=5, resulting in 75915.",

    options: ["20", "24", "25", "30"],
    correctAnswer: "25",
    explanation:
