    options: ["H", "I", "J", "K"],
    correctAnswer: "J",
    explanation:
      "The sequence increases by 2 letters each time: A (+2) = C, C (+2) = E, E (+2) = G. Following this pattern, the next letter after G is J.",

    options: ["18", "19", "20", "21"],
    correctAnswer: "19",
    explanation:
      "The series increases by 3 each time: 7 + 3 = 10, 10 + 3 = 13, 13 + 3 = 16. Thus, the next number is 16 + 3 = 19.",
