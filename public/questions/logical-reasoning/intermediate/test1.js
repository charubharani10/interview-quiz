    options: ["22", "23", "24", "25"],
    correctAnswer: "23",
    explanation:
      "The series increases by 3 each time: 11 + 3 = 14, 14 + 3 = 17, 17 + 3 = 20. Thus, the next number is 20 + 3 = 23.",

    options: ["162", "243", "324", "405"],
    correctAnswer: "243",
    explanation:
      "The sequence multiplies by 3 each time: 3 x 3 = 9, 9 x 3 = 27, 27 x 3 = 81. Thus, the next number is 81 x 3 = 243.",

    options: ["5", "15", "21", "25"],
    correctAnswer: "21",
    explanation:
      "The sequence increases by 5: 5 + 5 = 10, 10 + 5 = 15, 15 + 5 = 20. 21 does not fit this pattern.",

    options: ["20", "25", "30", "36"],
    correctAnswer: "25",
    explanation:
      "The series consists of squares of numbers: 1² = 1, 2² = 4, 3² = 9, 4² = 16. Thus, the next number is 5² = 25.",

    options: ["72", "108", "162", "216"],
    correctAnswer: "162",
    explanation:
      "The sequence multiplies by 3 each time: 2 x 3 = 6, 6 x 3 = 18, 18 x 3 = 54. Thus, the next number is 54 x 3 = 162.",

    question: "If 'TREE' is coded as '2018155', what is the code for 'PLANT'?",
    options: ["161212520", "161212515", "161211520", "161211515"],
    correctAnswer: "161212520",
    explanation:
      "The code converts letters to their alphabetical positions: T=20, R=18, E=5. For PLANT, P=16, L=12, A=1, N=14, T=20, resulting in 161212520.",

    options: ["31", "33", "35", "37"],
    correctAnswer: "31",
    explanation:
      "The series adds incrementally increasing numbers: 3 + 4 = 7, 7 + 6 = 13, 13 + 8 = 21. Thus, the next number is 21 + 10 = 31.",

    correctAnswer: "P",
    explanation:
      "The sequence increases by an incrementally increasing number of letters: C (+2) = E, E (+3) = H, H (+4) = L. Thus, the next letter is L + 5 = P.",

    question: "Which number does not belong in the sequence? 4, 7, 10, 14, 18",
    options: ["4", "10", "14", "18"],
    correctAnswer: "18",
    explanation:
      "The sequence increases by 3, then 4, then 3 again: 4 + 3 = 7, 7 + 3 = 10, 10 + 4 = 14, 14 + 4 = 18. 18 is an outlier as it should have been 17.",

    options: ["28", "30", "32", "36"],
    correctAnswer: "36",
    explanation:
      "The series increases by 6 each time: 6 + 6 = 12, 12 + 6 = 18, 18 + 6 = 24. Thus, the next number is 24 + 6 = 30.",

    correctAnswer: "O",
    explanation:
      "The series increases by 2 letters each time: G (+2) = I, I (+2) = K, K (+2) = M. Thus, the next letter is M + 2 = O.",
