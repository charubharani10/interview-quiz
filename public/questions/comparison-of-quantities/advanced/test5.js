    question:
      "If the area of a rectangle is 80 m² and its length is twice its width, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?",
    options: ["4 m by 20 m", "5 m by 16 m", "6 m by 14 m", "8 m by 10 m"],
    correctAnswer: "8 m by 10 m",
    explanation:
      "Let width = x, length = 2x. Area = length * width = 2x * x = 80, so 2x² = 80, x² = 40, x = √40 = 8, width = 8 m, length = 10 m.",

      "A shopkeeper sells an item for $250 after a 10% discount. What was the marked price?",
    options: ["$275", "$280", "$300", "$310"],
    correctAnswer: "$275",
    explanation:
      "Let marked price = x. Selling Price = x - 0.10x = 0.90x. Thus, 250 = 0.90x, so x = 250 / 0.90 = $275.",

      "A team of 6 workers can complete a project in 10 days. How many days will it take for 15 workers to complete the same project?",
    options: ["4 days", "6 days", "8 days", "12 days"],
    correctAnswer: "4 days",
    explanation:
      "Work done = 6 workers * 10 days = 60 worker-days. For 15 workers, Days = Total Work / Workers = 60 / 15 = 4 days.",

      "The ratio of the ages of two friends is 5:7. If the younger friend is 15 years old, how old is the older friend?",
    options: ["21", "25", "27", "30"],
    correctAnswer: "21",
    explanation:
      "Let the ages be 5x and 7x. If younger friend = 15 years, then 5x = 15, x = 3. Thus, older friend = 7x = 7 * 3 = 21.",

    options: ["20%", "25%", "30%", "35%"],
    correctAnswer: "25%",
    explanation:
      "Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 150 - 120 = 30. Profit Percentage = (30/120) * 100 = 25%.",

    correctAnswer: "$6,000",
    explanation:
      "Total Amount = Principal + Interest = 5000 + (5000 * 0.08 * 3) = 5000 + 1200 = $6,000.",

    options: ["76", "77", "78", "79"],
    correctAnswer: "80",
    explanation: "Average Score = (75 + 85) / 2 = 160 / 2 = 80.",

    correctAnswer: "480",
    explanation:
      "Production rate = 200 units / 5 days = 40 units/day. In 12 days, production = 40 * 12 = 480 units.",
