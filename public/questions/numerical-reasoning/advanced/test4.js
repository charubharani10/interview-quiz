    options: ["$236,090", "$242,000", "$251,400", "$259,400"],
    correctAnswer: "$251,400",
    explanation:

    options: ["10", "20", "30", "40"],
    correctAnswer: "30",
    explanation:
      "Sum of first 10 even numbers = 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 20 = 110. Sum of first 10 odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 19 = 100. Difference = 110 - 100 = 10.",

      "160 square cm",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "216 square cm",
    explanation:
      "Surface area of a cube = 6 × (side length)^2 = 6 × 6^2 = 6 × 36 = 216 square cm.",

      "A rectangle has an area of 72 square meters. If the length is 9 meters, what is the width?",
    options: ["6 meters", "7 meters", "8 meters", "9 meters"],
    correctAnswer: "8 meters",
    explanation: "Width = Area / Length = 72 / 9 = 8 meters.",

      "200 square meters",
      "240 square meters",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "180 square meters",
    explanation:
      "Let width be w and length be 2w. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(2w + w) = 6w = 60. Solving for w gives w = 10 meters and length = 20 meters. Area = length × width = 20 × 10 = 200 square meters.",

    correctAnswer: "36",
    explanation:
      "First reduction: 20% of $50 = $10. New price = $50 - $10 = $40. Second reduction: 10% of $40 = $4. Final price = $40 - $4 = $36.",
