      "If the ratio of two numbers is 5:7 and their sum is 48, what are the two numbers?",
    options: ["20 and 28", "25 and 23", "15 and 33", "30 and 18"],
    correctAnswer: "20 and 28",
    explanation:
      "Let the two numbers be 5x and 7x. Then, 5x + 7x = 48; 12x = 48; x = 4. The numbers are 5*4 = 20 and 7*4 = 28.",
