    question:
      "If the ratio of A to B is 3:4 and the ratio of B to C is 5:6, what is the ratio of A to C?",
    options: ["15:24", "18:20", "3:5", "9:10"],
    correctAnswer: "15:24",
    explanation:
      "The ratio of A to B is 3:4. To find the ratio of A to C, we first need to express B in terms of A. From A:B = 3:4, we have B = (4/3)A. Given B:C = 5:6, we have C = (6/5)B. Substituting for B gives C = (6/5)(4/3)A = (8/5)A. Therefore, the ratio A:C = 3:4 * 5:6 = 15:24.",

      "In a class, the ratio of boys to girls is 7:5. If there are 56 boys, how many girls are there?",
    options: ["40", "45", "35", "48"],
    correctAnswer: "40",
    explanation:
      "Using the ratio 7:5, if there are 56 boys, then the number of girls is (5/7) * 56 = 40.",

      "The ratio of the ages of two brothers is 4:5. If the elder brother is 25 years old, how old is the younger brother?",
    options: ["20 years", "22 years", "18 years", "24 years"],
    correctAnswer: "20 years",
    explanation:
      "Using the ratio 4:5, if the elder brother is 25 years, then the age of the younger brother is (4/5) * 25 = 20 years.",

    question:
      "A box contains red, green, and blue balls in the ratio of 3:2:5. If there are 50 balls in total, how many red balls are there?",
    options: ["15", "20", "25", "30"],
    correctAnswer: "15",
    explanation:
      "Using the ratio 3:2:5, the total parts = 3 + 2 + 5 = 10. Thus, the number of red balls = (3/10) * 50 = 15.",

      "If the ratio of the lengths of two rectangles is 2:3 and the longer rectangle is 24 cm long, what is the length of the shorter rectangle?",
    options: ["16 cm", "18 cm", "20 cm", "12 cm"],
    correctAnswer: "16 cm",
    explanation:
      "Using the ratio 2:3, if the longer rectangle is 24 cm, then the shorter rectangle is (2/3) * 24 = 16 cm.",

    options: ["60 meters", "50 meters", "40 meters", "30 meters"],
    correctAnswer: "60 meters",
    explanation:
      "Using the ratio 1:2:3, the total parts = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. The length of the longest rope = (3/6) * 120 = 60 meters.",
