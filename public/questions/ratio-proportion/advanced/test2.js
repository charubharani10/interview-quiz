      "A company has a budget ratio for marketing and research in the ratio 5:3. If the total budget is $320, how much is allocated to research?",
    options: ["$120", "$100", "$80", "$140"],
    correctAnswer: "$120",
    explanation:
      "In the ratio of 5:3, the total parts = 5 + 3 = 8. Research allocation = (3/8) * 320 = $120.",

    question:
      "In a class, the ratio of students who passed in Mathematics to those who failed is 9:1. If 90 students passed, how many students are in the class?",
    options: ["100", "110", "120", "90"],
    correctAnswer: "100",
    explanation:
      "Let the number of students who passed be 9x and those who failed be 1x. Given 9x = 90, we find x = 10. Total students = 9x + 1x = 10x = 100.",

      "The ratio of the ages of two friends is 3:4. If the sum of their ages is 56 years, what is the age of the older friend?",
    options: ["32", "36", "24", "28"],
    correctAnswer: "32",
    explanation:
      "Let the ages be 3x and 4x. Then, 3x + 4x = 56 gives x = 8. The older friend's age is 4 * 8 = 32.",

    options: ["105 cm", "100 cm", "90 cm", "85 cm"],
    correctAnswer: "105 cm",
    explanation:
      "If the shorter rope is 3x, then 3x = 45 gives x = 15. The longer rope is 7x = 7 * 15 = 105 cm.",
