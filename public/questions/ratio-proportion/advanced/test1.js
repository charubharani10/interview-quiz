    question:
      "In a certain class, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:5. If 10 more boys join the class, the ratio of boys to girls becomes 1:1. How many girls were in the class initially?",
    options: ["30", "40", "25", "35"],
    correctAnswer: "40",
    explanation:
      "Let the number of girls be 5x and boys be 4x. After adding 10 boys, we have 4x + 10 = 5x. Thus, x = 10, which makes the initial number of girls 5x = 50.",

    options: ["15 and 20", "18 and 24", "21 and 28", "12 and 16"],
    correctAnswer: "18 and 24",
    explanation:
      "Let A's age be 3x and B's age be 4x. After 5 years, (3x + 5)/(4x + 5) = 4/5. Solving gives x = 6, so their ages are 18 and 24.",
