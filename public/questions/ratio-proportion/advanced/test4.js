      "The ratio of the speeds of two cars is 5:7. If the first car travels 150 km in an hour, how far will the second car travel in the same time?",
    options: ["210 km", "250 km", "350 km", "200 km"],
    correctAnswer: "210 km",
    explanation:
      "If the speed ratio is 5:7 and the first car travels 150 km, then the second car travels = (7/5) * 150 = 210 km.",

      "If the ratio of two numbers is 1:4 and their sum is 50, what are the two numbers?",
    options: ["10 and 40", "15 and 35", "5 and 45", "20 and 30"],
    correctAnswer: "10 and 40",
    explanation:
      "Let the numbers be x and 4x. Then, x + 4x = 50 leads to 5x = 50, so x = 10. Thus, the numbers are 10 and 40.",

      "A mixture of alcohol and water is in the ratio 5:3. If there are 24 liters of alcohol, how much water is there?",
    options: ["16 liters", "12 liters", "8 liters", "6 liters"],
    correctAnswer: "14.4 liters",
    explanation: "If the ratio is 5:3, then water = (3/5) * 24 = 14.4 liters.",

    question:
      "In a group of students, the ratio of boys to girls is 7:5. If there are 42 boys, how many girls are there?",
    options: ["30", "36", "28", "24"],
    correctAnswer: "30",
    explanation:
      "If the ratio of boys to girls is 7:5 and there are 42 boys, then girls = (5/7) * 42 = 30.",

    correctAnswer: "27 and 18",
    explanation:
      "Let the numbers be 3x and 2x. Then, 3x + 2x = 45 leads to 5x = 45, so x = 9. Thus, the numbers are 27 and 18.",

      "The ratio of boys to girls in a school is 4:3. If there are 28 boys, how many girls are there?",
    options: ["21", "28", "20", "24"],
    correctAnswer: "21",

    options: ["1:2", "3:5", "5:6", "2:3"],
    correctAnswer: "1:2",
    explanation:
      "To find A:C, first express B in terms of A (B = (4/3)A) and then C in terms of B (C = (3/2)B). Thus, A:C = A:(3/2)(4/3)A = 1:2.",
