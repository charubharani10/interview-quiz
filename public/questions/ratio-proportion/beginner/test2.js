    question:
      "The ratio of the number of boys to girls in a class is 5:7. If there are 35 boys, how many girls are there?",
    options: ["42", "45", "49", "50"],
    correctAnswer: "49",
    explanation:
      "Let the number of girls be x. The ratio can be set up as 5/7 = 35/x. Cross multiplying gives 5x = 245, so x = 49.",

    question:
      "If 4 workers can complete a task in 15 days, how many workers are needed to complete the same task in 10 days?",
    options: ["6", "8", "10", "12"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "The work done is inversely proportional to the number of workers. If 4 workers take 15 days, then 6 workers will take 10 days.",

    question:
      "A recipe requires 2 cups of sugar for every 3 cups of flour. If you use 6 cups of sugar, how much flour do you need?",
    options: ["8 cups", "9 cups", "10 cups", "12 cups"],
    correctAnswer: "9 cups",
    explanation:
      "The ratio of sugar to flour is 2:3. If 6 cups of sugar are used, then flour needed = (6 * 3) / 2 = 9 cups.",

    question:
      "The ratio of a dog's age to a human's age is 1:7. If the dog is 5 years old, how old is it in human years?",
    options: ["25", "30", "35", "40"],
    correctAnswer: "35",
    explanation:
      "If 1 dog year equals 7 human years, then the dog's age in human years = 5 * 7 = 35.",

    question:
      "In a classroom, the ratio of pencils to pens is 3:2. If there are 12 pencils, how many pens are there?",
    options: ["6", "8", "10", "12"],
    correctAnswer: "8",
    explanation:
      "Let the number of pens be x. The ratio can be set up as 3/2 = 12/x. Cross multiplying gives 3x = 24, so x = 8.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If the ratio of the lengths of two sides of a rectangle is 4:5 and the longer side is 25 cm, what is the length of the shorter side?",
    options: ["20 cm", "22 cm", "24 cm", "26 cm"],
    correctAnswer: "20 cm",
    explanation:
      "Let the length of the shorter side be x. The ratio can be set up as 4/5 = x/25. Cross multiplying gives 4 * 25 = 5x, so x = 20.",
  },

    question:
      "A bag contains 3 red balls and 5 blue balls. What is the ratio of red balls to total balls?",
    options: ["3:5", "3:8", "5:8", "5:3"],
    correctAnswer: "3:8",
    explanation:
      "Total balls = 3 + 5 = 8. The ratio of red balls to total balls is 3:8.",

    question:
      "The ratio of the number of apples to oranges in a basket is 2:5. If there are 40 oranges, how many apples are there?",
    options: ["10", "16", "20", "24"],
    correctAnswer: "16",
    explanation:
      "Let the number of apples be x. The ratio can be set up as 2/5 = x/40. Cross multiplying gives 2 * 40 = 5x, so x = 16.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "If 10 kg of apples cost $30, how much would 25 kg of apples cost?",
    options: ["$60", "$70", "$75", "$80"],
    correctAnswer: "$75",
    explanation:
      "Cost per kg of apples = $30/10 = $3. For 25 kg, it would be 25 * $3 = $75.",

    question:
      "In a class, the ratio of boys to girls is 3:4. If there are 21 boys, how many students are there in total?",
    options: ["45", "49", "50", "52"],
    correctAnswer: "48",
    explanation:
      "If the ratio of boys to girls is 3:4, then for every 7 students, 3 are boys. Therefore, total students = (21/3) * 7 = 49.",
