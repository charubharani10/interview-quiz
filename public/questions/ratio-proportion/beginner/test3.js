    question:
      "The ratio of cats to dogs in a pet shop is 2:3. If there are 15 dogs, how many cats are there?",
    options: ["8", "10", "12", "14"],
    correctAnswer: "10",
    explanation:
      "Let the number of cats be x. The ratio can be set up as 2/3 = x/15. Cross multiplying gives 2 * 15 = 3x, so x = 10.",

    question:
      "A class has 30 students, and the ratio of boys to girls is 2:3. How many girls are in the class?",
    options: ["12", "18", "20", "24"],
    correctAnswer: "18",
    explanation:
      "Let the number of girls be x. The total parts in the ratio 2:3 is 5. So, x = (3/5) * 30 = 18.",

    question: "If 5 pens cost $15, how much would 8 pens cost?",
    options: ["$20", "$24", "$30", "$32"],
    correctAnswer: "$24",
    explanation:
      "The cost per pen = $15/5 = $3. Therefore, the cost of 8 pens = 8 * $3 = $24.",

    question:
      "In a fruit basket, the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:4. If there are 24 oranges, how many apples are there?",
    options: ["12", "18", "21", "24"],
    correctAnswer: "18",
    explanation:
      "Let the number of apples be x. The ratio can be set up as 3/4 = x/24. Cross multiplying gives 3 * 24 = 4x, so x = 18.",

    question:
      "The ages of two siblings are in the ratio 5:7. If the younger sibling is 10 years old, how old is the older sibling?",
    options: ["12", "14", "16", "18"],
    correctAnswer: "14",
    explanation:
      "If the younger sibling is 10 years, then using the ratio 5:7, the older sibling's age = (7/5) * 10 = 14.",

    options: ["240 km", "270 km", "300 km", "330 km"],
    correctAnswer: "300 km",
    explanation:
      "Speed = distance/time = 180 km/3 hours = 60 km/h. In 5 hours, distance = speed * time = 60 * 5 = 300 km.",
