      "A cone has a radius of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm. What is its volume?",
    options: ["25π cm³", "50π cm³", "100π cm³", "75π cm³"],
    correctAnswer: "100π cm³",
    explanation:
      "Volume of a cone = (1/3)πr²h = (1/3)π(5)²(10) = (1/3)π(25)(10) = 100π cm³.",

      "A rectangular prism has dimensions 4 cm, 5 cm, and 6 cm. What is the total surface area?",
    options: ["94 cm²", "88 cm²", "56 cm²", "70 cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "94 cm²",
    explanation:
      "Total Surface Area = 2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(4*5 + 4*6 + 5*6) = 2(20 + 24 + 30) = 94 cm².",

    options: ["40π cm²", "20π cm²", "10π cm²", "30π cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "20π cm²",
    explanation: "Lateral Surface Area = 2πrh = 2π(2)(5) = 20π cm².",

      "A spherical balloon has a radius of 6 cm. What is the volume of the balloon?",
    options: ["144π cm³", "216π cm³", "288π cm³", "72π cm³"],
    correctAnswer: "288π cm³",
    explanation:
      "Volume of a sphere = (4/3)πr³ = (4/3)π(6)³ = (4/3)π(216) = 288π cm³.",

    question:
      "The perimeter of a rectangular garden is 80 m. If the length is twice the width, what are the dimensions of the garden?",
    options: ["20 m × 10 m", "30 m × 15 m", "15 m × 30 m", "40 m × 10 m"],
    correctAnswer: "20 m × 10 m",
    explanation:
      "Let width = x; then length = 2x. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 80, thus 2(2x + x) = 80 → 6x = 80 → x = 13.33. Thus, width = 10 m and length = 20 m.",

      "A cone has a slant height of 10 cm and a radius of 6 cm. What is the curved surface area of the cone?",
    options: ["36π cm²", "60π cm²", "30π cm²", "48π cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "60π cm²",
    explanation: "Curved Surface Area = πrl = π(6)(10) = 60π cm².",

    options: ["30 cm²", "40 cm²", "25 cm²", "35 cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "40 cm²",
    explanation:
      "Area = (1/2)(b1 + b2)h = (1/2)(10 + 6)(5) = (1/2)(16)(5) = 40 cm².",

    question: "A cube has a volume of 64 cm³. What is the length of each side?",
    options: ["4 cm", "5 cm", "6 cm", "7 cm"],
    correctAnswer: "4 cm",
    explanation: "Volume of a cube = side³ = 64 → side = 4 cm.",
