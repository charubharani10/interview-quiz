      "A cone has a radius of 4 cm and a height of 9 cm. What is the total surface area of the cone?",
    options: ["76π cm²", "80π cm²", "64π cm²", "90π cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "76π cm²",
    explanation:
      "Total Surface Area = πr(r + l), where l = √(r² + h²) = √(4² + 9²) = √(16 + 81) = √97. Therefore, TSA = π * 4 * (4 + √97) = 76π cm².",

    question: "A sphere has a radius of 7 cm. What is its surface area?",
    options: ["154 cm²", "276 cm²", "308 cm²", "368 cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "308 cm²",
    explanation:
      "Surface Area of a sphere = 4πr² = 4π(7)² = 4π(49) = 196π cm².",

      "A rectangular tank has a length of 10 m, a width of 4 m, and a height of 2 m. How much water can it hold in liters?",
    options: ["8000 liters", "6000 liters", "4000 liters", "2000 liters"],
    correctAnswer: "8000 liters",
    explanation:
      "Volume = length × width × height = 10 × 4 × 2 = 80 m³. Converting to liters: 80 m³ × 1000 = 80000 liters.",

      "The perimeter of a rectangular field is 60 m. If the length is twice the width, what are the dimensions of the field?",
    options: ["10 m × 5 m", "15 m × 10 m", "20 m × 30 m", "12 m × 18 m"],
    correctAnswer: "10 m × 5 m",
    explanation:
      "Let width = x; then length = 2x. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 60, thus 2(2x + x) = 60 → 6x = 60 → x = 10. Therefore, length = 20 m and width = 10 m.",

    options: ["314 m²", "3140 m²", "352 m²", "250 m²"],
    correctAnswer: "314 m²",
    explanation:
      "Area of the outer circle = π(25 + 2)² - π(25)² = π(27² - 25²) = π(729 - 625) = 104π m².",

      "A right-angled triangle has legs of lengths 6 cm and 8 cm. What is the area of the triangle?",
    options: ["24 cm²", "32 cm²", "36 cm²", "48 cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "24 cm²",
    explanation: "Area = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 6 × 8 = 24 cm².",

      "A cone has a base radius of 3 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is the volume of the cone?",
    options: ["36π cm³", "45π cm³", "60π cm³", "72π cm³"],
    correctAnswer: "36π cm³",
    explanation:
      "Volume = (1/3)πr²h = (1/3)π(3)²(12) = (1/3)π(9)(12) = 36π cm³.",

    options: ["62 cm²", "46 cm²", "58 cm²", "42 cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "62 cm²",
    explanation:
      "Total Surface Area = 2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(5*3 + 5*4 + 3*4) = 2(15 + 20 + 12) = 62 cm².",

    options: ["32 cm³", "96 cm³", "48 cm³", "64 cm³"],
    correctAnswer: "64 cm³",
    explanation:
      "Volume = (1/3) × base area × height = (1/3) × (8 × 8) × 6 = (1/3) × 64 × 6 = 128 cm³.",
