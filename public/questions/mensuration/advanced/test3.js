      "A right circular cone has a base radius of 3 cm and a height of 4 cm. What is the slant height of the cone?",
    options: ["5 cm", "6 cm", "7 cm", "8 cm"],
    correctAnswer: "5 cm",
    explanation:
      "Using the Pythagorean theorem, slant height = √(radius² + height²) = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5 cm.",

      "A rectangular garden has a length of 15 m and a width of 10 m. A path of width 1 m is built around it. What is the area of the path?",
    options: ["56 m²", "66 m²", "70 m²", "76 m²"],
    correctAnswer: "76 m²",
    explanation:
      "Area of the larger rectangle (including the path) = (15 + 2)(10 + 2) = 17 × 12 = 204 m². Area of the garden = 15 × 10 = 150 m². Area of the path = 204 - 150 = 54 m².",

      "A cylindrical tank has a radius of 2 m and a height of 5 m. How many liters of water can it hold? (1 m³ = 1000 liters)",
    options: ["12.57 liters", "25.13 liters", "50.27 liters", "100.54 liters"],
    correctAnswer: "12.57 liters",
    explanation:
      "Volume = πr²h = π(2)²(5) = 20π m³. Converting to liters: 20π × 1000 = 6283.18 liters.",

      "A swimming pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism with a length of 20 m, width of 10 m, and depth of 2 m. How much water in liters can the pool hold?",
    options: ["4000 liters", "5000 liters", "6000 liters", "7000 liters"],
    correctAnswer: "4000 liters",
    explanation:
      "Volume = length × width × depth = 20 × 10 × 2 = 400 m³. Converting to liters: 400 m³ × 1000 = 400,000 liters.",

      "The area of a circle is 50π cm². What is the radius of the circle?",
    options: ["5 cm", "10 cm", "7.07 cm", "8.94 cm"],
    correctAnswer: "5 cm",
    explanation: "Area = πr² = 50π. Thus, r² = 50, r = √50 = 5√2 cm ≈ 5 cm.",

    question:
      "A hollow cylinder has an outer radius of 5 cm and an inner radius of 3 cm, with a height of 10 cm. What is the volume of the material used to make the cylinder?",
    options: ["60π cm³", "40π cm³", "20π cm³", "80π cm³"],
    correctAnswer: "40π cm³",
    explanation:
      "Volume of outer cylinder = πR²h = π(5)²(10) = 250π cm³; Volume of inner cylinder = πr²h = π(3)²(10) = 90π cm³. Volume of material = 250π - 90π = 160π cm³.",

    question:
      "If a square's area is 64 cm², what is the length of its diagonal?",
    options: ["8√2 cm", "16 cm", "12 cm", "10 cm"],
    correctAnswer: "8√2 cm",
    explanation:
      "Area = side²; thus, side = √64 = 8 cm. Diagonal = side√2 = 8√2 cm.",

      "A box is in the shape of a cuboid with dimensions 2 m, 3 m, and 4 m. If it is filled with water, what is the total surface area of the water surface?",
    options: ["24 m²", "36 m²", "28 m²", "40 m²"],
    correctAnswer: "24 m²",
    explanation:
      "Surface Area = 2(lb + bh + hl) = 2(2*3 + 3*4 + 4*2) = 2(6 + 12 + 8) = 2(26) = 52 m². Total surface area = 24 m² (excluding the bottom).",

    options: ["60 cm³", "80 cm³", "100 cm³", "120 cm³"],
    correctAnswer: "120 cm³",
    explanation:
      "Volume = (1/3) × base area × height = (1/3) × (6 × 6) × 10 = 120 cm³.",

      "A rectangular prism has dimensions 4 cm × 3 cm × 6 cm. If the length is doubled and the height is halved, what is the new volume?",
    options: ["72 cm³", "48 cm³", "96 cm³", "120 cm³"],
    correctAnswer: "96 cm³",
    explanation:
      "New dimensions: 8 cm (length) × 3 cm (width) × 3 cm (height). New volume = 8 × 3 × 3 = 72 cm³.",
