    options: ["100π cm²", "50π cm²", "80π cm²", "60π cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "88π cm²",
    explanation:
      "Total Surface Area = 2πr(h + r) = 2π × 4 cm × (10 cm + 4 cm) = 88π cm².",

      "A rectangular prism has a length of 12 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 3 cm. What is its surface area?",
    options: ["150 cm²", "180 cm²", "200 cm²", "100 cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "150 cm²",
    explanation:
      "Surface Area = 2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(12 cm × 5 cm + 12 cm × 3 cm + 5 cm × 3 cm) = 150 cm².",

      "A garden is in the shape of a trapezium with bases of 10 m and 15 m, and a height of 6 m. What is the area of the garden?",
    options: ["90 m²", "80 m²", "70 m²", "60 m²"],
    correctAnswer: "75 m²",
    explanation:
      "Area = (1/2) × (b₁ + b₂) × h = (1/2) × (10 m + 15 m) × 6 m = 75 m².",
