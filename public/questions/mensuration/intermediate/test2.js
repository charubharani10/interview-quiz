    options: ["25000 liters", "20000 liters", "15000 liters", "30000 liters"],
    correctAnswer: "25000 liters",
    explanation:
      "Volume = Length × Width × Depth; assuming depth = 1 m, Volume = 25 m × 10 m × 1 m = 250 m³ = 25000 liters.",

      "If the height of a triangle is tripled and the base remains the same, how does the area change?",
    options: ["Remains the same", "Doubles", "Triples", "Quadruples"],
    correctAnswer: "Triples",
    explanation:
      "Area = 1/2 × Base × Height; if height is tripled, the area also triples.",
