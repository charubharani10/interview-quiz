    question: "A cube has a side length of 5 cm. What is its surface area?",
    options: ["50 cm²", "100 cm²", "75 cm²", "125 cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "150 cm²",
    explanation: "Surface Area = 6a² = 6 × (5 cm)² = 150 cm².",

      "What is the volume of a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm and a height of 10 cm?",
    options: ["84.78 cm³", "94.2 cm³", "75.36 cm³", "30.84 cm³"],
    correctAnswer: "94.2 cm³",
    explanation: "Volume = πr²h = 3.14 × (3 cm)² × 10 cm ≈ 94.2 cm³.",

      "A rectangular field is 30 m long and 20 m wide. What is the area?",
    options: ["600 m²", "500 m²", "400 m²", "300 m²"],
    correctAnswer: "600 m²",
    explanation: "Area = Length × Width = 30 m × 20 m = 600 m².",

    question:
      "If the radius of a sphere is doubled, how does its volume change?",
    options: ["Remains the same", "Doubles", "Triples", "Quadruples"],
    correctAnswer: "Octuples",
    explanation:
      "Volume = (4/3)πr³; if radius is doubled, volume increases by a factor of 2³ = 8.",

    question:
      "A cone has a base radius of 5 cm and a height of 12 cm. What is its slant height?",
    options: ["13 cm", "15 cm", "17 cm", "14 cm"],
    correctAnswer: "13 cm",
    explanation:
      "Slant Height = √(r² + h²) = √(5² + 12²) = √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13 cm.",

      "What is the area of a trapezium with bases of 10 cm and 14 cm, and a height of 6 cm?",
    options: ["72 cm²", "60 cm²", "54 cm²", "84 cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "72 cm²",
    explanation:
      "Area = (1/2) × (b₁ + b₂) × h = (1/2) × (10 cm + 14 cm) × 6 cm = 72 cm².",
