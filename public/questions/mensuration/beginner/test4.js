    options: ["84 cm²", "96 cm²", "72 cm²", "100 cm²"],
    correctAnswer: "84 cm²",
    explanation: "Area = Length × Width = 12 cm × 7 cm = 84 cm².",

    question: "If the radius of a circle is doubled, what happens to its area?",
    options: [
      "It doubles",
      "It triples",
      "It quadruples",
      "It remains the same",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "It quadruples",
    explanation:
      "Area = π × radius²; if radius is doubled, new area = π × (2r)² = 4πr².",

      "A cone has a radius of 4 cm and a height of 9 cm. What is its volume?",
    options: ["75.36 cm³", "36.00 cm³", "48.00 cm³", "113.04 cm³"],
    correctAnswer: "150.72 cm³",
    explanation:
      "Volume = (1/3) × π × radius² × height = (1/3) × 3.14 × (4 cm)² × 9 cm ≈ 150.72 cm³.",

      "What is the length of the diagonal of a rectangle with a length of 6 cm and a width of 8 cm?",
    options: ["10 cm", "12 cm", "14 cm", "16 cm"],
    correctAnswer: "10 cm",
    explanation:
      "Diagonal = √(Length² + Width²) = √(6² + 8²) = √(36 + 64) = √100 = 10 cm.",

    options: ["60 m", "50 m", "40 m", "70 m"],
    correctAnswer: "60 m",
    explanation: "Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width) = 2 × (20 m + 10 m) = 60 m.",
