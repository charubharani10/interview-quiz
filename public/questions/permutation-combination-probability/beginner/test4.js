      "In a survey of 100 people, 40 like apples, 50 like bananas, and 10 like both. What is the probability that a randomly selected person likes only bananas?",
    options: ["1/10", "2/5", "3/10", "4/5"],
    correctAnswer: "4/10",
    explanation:
      "The number of people who like only bananas = 50 - 10 = 40. So, P(Only Bananas) = 40/100 = 4/10.",

    options: ["5", "10", "15", "20"],
    correctAnswer: "10",
    explanation:
      "The number of ways to choose 2 candies from 5 is given by C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = 10.",
