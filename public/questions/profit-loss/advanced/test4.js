    question:
      "A company purchases a set of machinery for $50,000. After one year, it sells the machinery for $55,000. If the company incurs a maintenance cost of $2,000 during the year, what is the overall profit or loss?",
    options: ["$3,000", "$5,000", "$7,000", "$6,000"],
    correctAnswer: "$3,000",
    explanation:
      "Total Cost = $50,000 + $2,000 = $52,000. Selling Price = $55,000. Profit = Selling Price - Total Cost = $55,000 - $52,000 = $3,000.",

    question:
      "A shopkeeper marked up the price of an item by 40% and then gave a discount of 10% on the marked price. If the cost price of the item is $200, what is the selling price?",
    options: ["$210", "$220", "$230", "$240"],
    correctAnswer: "$216",
    explanation:
      "Marked Price = Cost Price + (40% of Cost Price) = $200 + $80 = $280. Discount = 10% of Marked Price = $280 × 0.10 = $28. Selling Price = Marked Price - Discount = $280 - $28 = $252.",

    question:
      "A man bought a car for $20,000 and sold it after two years for $15,000. He also spent $2,000 on repairs during this time. What is the overall loss percentage?",
    options: ["15%", "10%", "12.5%", "20%"],
    correctAnswer: "35%",
    explanation:
      "Total Cost = Purchase Price + Repairs = $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000. Selling Price = $15,000. Loss = Total Cost - Selling Price = $22,000 - $15,000 = $7,000. Loss Percentage = (Loss / Total Cost) × 100 = ($7,000 / $22,000) × 100 ≈ 31.82%.",

    question:
      "A product is sold at a profit of 20%. If the selling price is $240, what was the cost price?",
    options: ["$200", "$220", "$180", "$250"],
    correctAnswer: "$200",
    explanation:
      "Let Cost Price be x. Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit = x + 0.20x = 1.20x. Thus, 1.20x = $240, so x = $240 / 1.20 = $200.",

    options: ["30%", "25%", "20%", "15%"],
    correctAnswer: "20%",
    explanation:
      "Total Cost Price = $300 + $450 = $750. Selling Price = $900. Profit = Selling Price - Total Cost Price = $900 - $750 = $150. Profit Percentage = (Profit / Total Cost Price) × 100 = ($150 / $750) × 100 = 20%.",

      "An item is purchased for $1,000 and sold at a loss of 25%. It is then resold at a profit of 40% of the new cost price. What is the final selling price?",
    options: ["$1,000", "$950", "$1,050", "$900"],
    correctAnswer: "$1,050",
    explanation:
      "Selling Price after loss = $1,000 - (25% of $1,000) = $1,000 - $250 = $750. Profit on new cost price = 40% of $750 = $300. Final Selling Price = $750 + $300 = $1,050.",

      "A businessman sells a laptop for $1,200, making a profit of 20%. What was the cost price of the laptop?",
    options: ["$1,000", "$1,100", "$1,200", "$1,300"],
    correctAnswer: "$1,000",
    explanation:
      "Let Cost Price = x. Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit = x + 0.20x = 1.20x. Therefore, 1.20x = $1,200, so x = $1,200 / 1.20 = $1,000.",

    options: ["-5%", "0%", "5%", "10%"],
    correctAnswer: "-5%",
    explanation:
      "Cost Price of both items = $500 + $500 = $1,000. Selling Price of first item = $500 + (10% of $500) = $500 + $50 = $550. Selling Price of second item = $500 - (20% of $500) = $500 - $100 = $400. Total Selling Price = $550 + $400 = $950. Overall Loss = Total Cost Price - Total Selling Price = $1,000 - $950 = $50. Loss Percentage = (Loss / Total Cost Price) × 100 = ($50 / $1,000) × 100 = 5%.",
