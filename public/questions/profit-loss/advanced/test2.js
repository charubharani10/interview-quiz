    question:
      "A store owner buys a television for $800 and sells it for $1,000. Later, he offers a 15% discount on the selling price. What is the profit percentage after the discount?",
    options: ["10%", "15%", "20%", "25%"],
    correctAnswer: "15%",
    explanation:
      "Selling Price after discount = $1,000 - ($1,000 × 0.15) = $1,000 - $150 = $850. Profit = Selling Price after discount - Cost Price = $850 - $800 = $50. Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100 = ($50 / $800) × 100 = 6.25%.",

      "A wholesaler sells a product to a retailer at a profit of 30%. If the retailer sells it to the customer for $1,560, what is the cost price for the wholesaler?",
    options: ["$1,200", "$1,200", "$1,000", "$1,500"],
    correctAnswer: "$1,200",
    explanation:
      "Let Cost Price for wholesaler = x. Selling Price for retailer = x + 30% of x = 1.3x. Given Selling Price for customer = $1,560, so 1.3x = $1,560. Therefore, x = $1,560 / 1.3 = $1,200.",

      "A company sells a product for $150, which is 20% more than the cost price. What is the cost price of the product?",
    options: ["$120", "$125", "$130", "$140"],
    correctAnswer: "$125",
    explanation:
      "Let Cost Price = x. Selling Price = x + 20% of x = 1.2x. Given Selling Price = $150, so 1.2x = $150. Therefore, x = $150 / 1.2 = $125.",

      "A car dealer offers a 10% discount on a car priced at $30,000. If the dealer's cost price was $25,000, what is the profit percentage after the discount?",
    options: ["10%", "15%", "20%", "25%"],
    correctAnswer: "5%",
    explanation:
      "Selling Price after discount = $30,000 - ($30,000 × 0.10) = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000. Profit = Selling Price after discount - Cost Price = $27,000 - $25,000 = $2,000. Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100 = ($2,000 / $25,000) × 100 = 8%.",

      "A manufacturer has a fixed cost of $50,000 and a variable cost of $20 per unit. If the selling price per unit is $30 and they sell 5,000 units, what is the total profit?",
    options: ["$75,000", "$100,000", "$50,000", "$25,000"],
    correctAnswer: "$25,000",
    explanation:
      "Total Revenue = Selling Price × Number of units = $30 × 5,000 = $150,000. Total Costs = Fixed Costs + (Variable Cost × Number of units) = $50,000 + ($20 × 5,000) = $50,000 + $100,000 = $150,000. Profit = Total Revenue - Total Costs = $150,000 - $150,000 = $0.",

      "A trader bought two types of shoes. Type A cost $60 per pair and Type B cost $90 per pair. If the trader buys 10 pairs of Type A and 5 pairs of Type B and sells them for $80 and $120 respectively, what is his overall profit?",
    options: ["$200", "$250", "$300", "$150"],
    correctAnswer: "$200",
    explanation:
      "Total Cost Price = (10 × $60) + (5 × $90) = $600 + $450 = $1,050. Total Selling Price = (10 × $80) + (5 × $120) = $800 + $600 = $1,400. Total Profit = Total Selling Price - Total Cost Price = $1,400 - $1,050 = $350.",

      "An investor bought shares for $500 and sold them at a loss of 30%. He then reinvested the remaining amount in another share and sold it for a gain of 50% on the cost price of $300. What is the overall profit or loss?",
    options: ["$-90", "$-80", "$80", "$90"],
    correctAnswer: "$-90",
    explanation:
      "Loss on first investment = $500 × 0.30 = $150. Selling Price of first investment = $500 - $150 = $350. Gain on second investment = $300 × 0.50 = $150. Selling Price of second investment = $300 + $150 = $450. Overall Profit = $450 - $500 = $-50.",

    question:
      "A factory produces two types of gadgets. Type X costs $50 each and Type Y costs $70 each. If the factory sells Type X at a price of $80 and Type Y at $100, and sells twice as many Type X as Type Y, what is the overall profit?",
    options: ["$300", "$500", "$400", "$600"],
    correctAnswer: "$300",
    explanation:
      "Let the number of Type Y sold = y. Then Type X sold = 2y. Total Cost Price = (50 × 2y) + (70 × y) = $100y + $70y = $170y. Total Selling Price = (80 × 2y) + (100 × y) = $160y + $100y = $260y. Total Profit = Total Selling Price - Total Cost Price = $260y - $170y = $90y. Profit percentage = (90y/170y) x 100 = 52.94%.",
