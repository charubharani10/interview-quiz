      "A merchant bought a shipment of goods for $30,000. He sells them at a profit of 25%. If he incurs additional shipping costs of $2,500, what is the total selling price of the goods?",
    options: ["$37,500", "$38,750", "$39,500", "$40,000"],
    correctAnswer: "$39,500",
    explanation:
      "Total Cost = Purchase Price + Shipping Costs = $30,000 + $2,500 = $32,500. Profit = 25% of Total Cost = 0.25 × $32,500 = $8,125. Selling Price = Total Cost + Profit = $32,500 + $8,125 = $39,625.",

      "A car dealer bought a car for $18,000 and sold it for $22,500. If the dealer also spent $1,500 on repairs, what is the overall profit or loss?",
    options: ["$2,000", "$2,500", "$3,000", "$4,000"],
    correctAnswer: "$2,000",
    explanation:
      "Total Cost = Purchase Price + Repairs = $18,000 + $1,500 = $19,500. Selling Price = $22,500. Profit = Selling Price - Total Cost = $22,500 - $19,500 = $3,000.",

    question:
      "A shopkeeper marks up the price of a product by 50%. If the cost price of the product is $80, what will be the selling price after a discount of 20% on the marked price?",
    options: ["$96", "$100", "$120", "$140"],
    correctAnswer: "$104",
    explanation:
      "Marked Price = Cost Price + (50% of Cost Price) = $80 + $40 = $120. Discount = 20% of Marked Price = $120 × 0.20 = $24. Selling Price = Marked Price - Discount = $120 - $24 = $96.",

    options: ["$1,200", "$1,500", "$1,750", "$2,000"],
    correctAnswer: "$2,475",
    explanation:
      "Initial Investment = $5,000. Selling Price = $6,500. Profit from Sale = Selling Price - Investment = $6,500 - $5,000 = $1,500. New Investment = $6,500; Return = 15% of $6,500 = $975. Total Profit = Profit from Sale + Return = $1,500 + $975 = $2,475.",

    correctAnswer: "$238",
    explanation:
      "Selling Price after loss = $250 - (15% of $250) = $250 - $37.50 = $212.50. Profit on new selling price = 20% of $212.50 = $42.50. Final Selling Price = $212.50 + $42.50 = $255.",

    options: ["$700", "$800", "$900", "$1,000"],
    correctAnswer: "$800",
    explanation:
      "Cost Price = 100 shares × $40 = $4,000. Selling Price = 100 shares × $50 = $5,000. Brokerage Fee = 2% of $5,000 = $100. Net Selling Price = $5,000 - $100 = $4,900. Profit = Net Selling Price - Cost Price = $4,900 - $4,000 = $900.",

    options: ["$350", "$375", "$400", "$425"],
    correctAnswer: "$375",
    explanation:
      "Selling Price = $450. Let Cost Price be x. Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price. Thus, $450 = x + 0.20x + $50. Rearranging gives x = $450 - $50 = $400. Profit = 0.20x = 0.20 × $400 = $80.",

      "A company sells a product at a price of $150 after giving a discount of 25% on the marked price. What is the cost price if the profit made is 20%?",
    options: ["$100", "$120", "$140", "$160"],
    correctAnswer: "$120",
    explanation:
      "Let Marked Price = x. After 25% discount, Selling Price = x - 0.25x = 0.75x = $150. Thus, x = $150 / 0.75 = $200. Cost Price = Selling Price / (1 + Profit%) = $150 / 1.20 = $125.",
